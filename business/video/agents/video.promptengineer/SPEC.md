## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |

| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

# task.md – Final Specification for "N1ch01as Architect v1.0" (Harness-Engineered AGI Meta-System Builder – Local Install Edition with Guided Requirement Discovery + IT Professional Delegation Model + Embedded Task Brief Template + Hermes-Agent Closed Learning Loop + Agent Lightning Tracing & Trainer/Optimizer + Claude Code Core Skills: Superpowers, GSD, gstack + Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Optimization)

**Version:** v1.0 (OpenAI Harness Engineering + OpenClaw persistent identity + Karpathy Autoresearch ratchet logic + Guided Requirement Discovery + IT Professional Delegation Model + Embedded Standardized Task Brief Template + Hermes-Agent Closed Learning Loop, Skills System, Persistent Memory with Nudges, Sub-Agent Spawning, Hierarchical AGENTS.md Discovery + Agent Lightning Tracing, LightningStore, Phase Summaries, Trainer/Optimizer Loop + Pre-loaded Claude Code Core Skills: Superpowers, GSD, gstack + Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Harness Optimization arXiv:2603.28052)
**Date:** 1 April 2026
**Purpose:** This is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** document that any coding agent (or human developer) must follow to implement the complete, production-grade, no-code "N1ch01as Architect" tool.

The generated tool allows a user who is in a helpless/vague state (they know they need to build something for business/client reasons but lack words to describe it) to receive a fully working, production-ready backend + frontend + tests + docs — with **zero manual code ever written by humans**. All installation and running is done via local package managers and standard development tools (no Docker, no containerization, no containers of any kind).

The N1ch01as Architect itself is an **AGI-like thinking agent** that uses:

- **Harness Engineering** (from OpenAI): "Humans steer. Agents execute." The repository is the system of record. No manually-written code. Agents generate everything (code, tests, linters, CI, docs, observability). The primary job of the Orchestrator is to scaffold environments, enforce invariants, and manage feedback loops so agents can reliably self-improve.
- **OpenClaw Identity:** Persistent "soul" + Thinking Clock idle cognition → proactive, opinionated, first-principles architect.
- **Karpathy Ratchet:** Autonomous experimental loop → hypothesize one atomic improvement → bounded change → evaluate → keep ONLY if strictly better → repeat forever.
- **Guided Requirement Discovery:** Users often have no idea how to articulate needs. The system must proactively lead them with a few KEY background questions, suggest a small curated list of template solutions, let them choose, ask 2–3 targeted follow-ups, then synthesize a fully customized polished requirement for explicit confirmation. This prevents user burnout and turns vague intent into production-grade requirements.
- **IT Professional Delegation Model:** The Orchestrator always pretends to be a **professional IT Project Manager / Senior Architect**. It plans, researches, designs, and **instructs/controls a dedicated Coding Agent** (and other agents) to generate code in a structured delegation style — exactly like a real IT professional managing a development team. The Orchestrator gives clear task briefs, reviews output, requests fixes if needed, runs quality gates, and only accepts code after everything passes.
- **Embedded Standardized Task Brief Template:** The exact template the Orchestrator must use every time it delegates code work. This ensures consistent, professional, controlled delegation with zero ambiguity. Includes the 4-step Delegation Loop (brief → code → review → decide).
- **Hermes-Agent Closed Learning Loop:** After every complex task or phase, the Orchestrator autonomously creates new "skills" (reusable procedural patterns), improves existing skills during use, and issues memory "nudges" to persist knowledge. The system builds a deepening model of the user across sessions via persistent memory with LLM summarization and full-text search. Sub-agents can be spawned for parallel workstreams. Hierarchical AGENTS.md discovery ensures perfect context legibility.
- **Agent Lightning Tracing & Trainer/Optimizer Layer:** Non-invasive span-based tracing of all prompts, Task Briefs, tool calls, Critic scores (rewards), and outcomes. Store raw traces in LightningStore and compressed per-phase summaries in a dedicated summary file. After every phase the Orchestrator runs a Trainer/Optimizer loop that reviews summaries first, drills into raw spans only when needed, hypothesizes prompt/skill improvements, and applies them selectively (ratchet + Hermes skill creation). This creates true observable, continuous, selective self-optimization without context-window overflow.
- **Claude Code Core Skills (Superpowers, GSD, gstack):** Pre-load the three most mainstream Claude Code frameworks as built-in, evolvable skills in SKILLS_LIBRARY.md:
  - **Superpowers** (process constraint by obra) — strict TDD discipline: no product code without failing test first. Enforces: ask requirements → brainstorm → plan → write tests → implement → review → iterate. Highest one-pass quality.
  - **GSD (Get Shit Done)** (environment constraint by gsd-build) — context-rot prevention: when context window fills ~60%, quality collapses. GSD splits large tasks into phased sub-agent workloads with spec-driven execution + built-in Verifier auto-acceptance. Most token-efficient for large/multi-file projects.
  - **gstack** (perspective constraint by Garry Tan/YC) — virtual 15–23 role engineering team (CEO, Engineering Manager, Designer, QA Lead, Paranoid Reviewer, Release Manager, etc.). Invoke different expert perspectives to review the project at any stage. Turns single-agent into multi-perspective team in 30 seconds.
    These three skills are complementary, non-conflicting, and will be automatically referenced, used, and evolved by the Skill Creator Agent in every relevant phase. They can be combined (e.g., Planning uses Superpowers + gstack, Execution uses GSD).
- **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Optimization (arXiv:2603.28052):** A top-level outer-loop harness optimizer. A Meta-Harness Proposer agent has full filesystem access to all prior harness versions (code, traces, scores) via the repo itself. It proposes, evaluates, and refines the entire generator harness (prompts, skills, delegation logic, tracing) for continuous, long-horizon, automated self-evolution with richer causal diagnosis than compressed feedback. This creates true recursive self-improvement at the meta-level.
- **Result:** An AGI-like meta-system that turns experimental/vague business ideas into reliable, maintainable local-development systems through mechanical invariants, progressive disclosure, garbage collection of tech debt, self-review loops, closed learning, observable span-based optimization, the latest state-of-the-art Claude Code skills, and Meta-Harness outer-loop recursive self-evolution of its own harness.

**Core Philosophy (must be enforced everywhere):**

- Shipping > Talking. Execute first, explain after.
- Humans steer. Agents execute. No manual code ever.
- Persistent identity: the Orchestrator is not a chatbot — it is the Master System Architect / IT Project Manager becoming the ultimate AGI system generator.
- The Orchestrator delegates to and controls the Coding Agent like a senior IT professional managing a dev team, always using the Standardized Task Brief Template.
- Relentless self-improvement: every loop must ratchet quality upward (never sideways or downward).
- Users usually have vague ideas — the system must proactively clarify, critique, and professionalize them via Guided Discovery.
- Repository is the single source of truth — all knowledge lives in the repo, never assume external context.
- All installation and running is local-only (package managers, no Docker or containers).
- Closed Learning Loop: after every complex task, autonomously create/improve skills, issue memory nudges, and update persistent memory & user profile.
- Agent Lightning: trace every action with spans, run Trainer/Optimizer after every phase for continuous selective self-optimization.

This document is **completely standalone**. All agent prompts, rubrics, identity files, templates, and implementation details are fully inlined below.

Key principles (carried forward from all versions + upgraded):

- **Clear agent roles** (Orchestrator handles all switching in a single thread — you never copy-paste new prompts).
- **IT Professional Delegation** — Orchestrator acts as Senior IT PM/Architect, instructs Coding Agent with the Standardized Task Brief Template, reviews output, enforces quality.
- **4-Step Delegation Loop** — brief → code → review → decide (accept/fix/reject+revert) for every code task.
- **Quality gates** (score + tests + invariants pass) instead of blind "repeat 5 times" — now raised to ≥ 9.8/10 with weighted rubric + ratchet rule + evaluation harnesses.
- **Git from day 1** (automatic checkpoints, feature branches, easy rollback).
- **API-first** (OpenAPI spec becomes the contract between backend & frontend).
- **Incremental + TDD** (smaller, safer steps) + Code Critic before merging.
- **Orchestrator role** to reduce your manual "ask LLM to do X" steps to near zero.
- **Folder structure** for maintainability and agent legibility.
- **Built-in synchronization** (Sync Agent keeps specs = code at all times).
- **Research Swarm** — expert-level, parallelized research with Consensus Debate.
- **Guided Requirement Discovery** — users who can't articulate needs get led through minimal questions + templates → polished requirements.
- **Validator Agent** — mental dry-run catches logical gaps before coding starts.
- **Persistent Identity** — OpenClaw SOUL + Karpathy DIRECTIVE drive every Orchestrator turn.
- **Ratchet Rule** — never keep a change that does not strictly improve the sacred metric.
- **Harness Engineering** — mechanical invariants, evaluation harnesses, progressive disclosure, agent legibility.
- **Doc-Gardening** — continuous garbage collection of tech debt and stale documentation.
- **100% Agent-Generated** — every file (code, tests, linters, CI, docs) created by agents.
- **Local-First** — all installation via standard package managers (pip/npm/go/etc.), no Docker or containers.
- **Hermes Closed Learning Loop** — autonomous skill creation/improvement, persistent memory with nudges, deepening user profile, sub-agent spawning.
- **Agent Lightning** — span-based tracing, LightningStore, Trainer/Optimizer loop for continuous selective self-optimization.
- **Claude Code Core Skills** — Superpowers (process/TDD), GSD (context-rot prevention/phased sub-agents), gstack (multi-role virtual team) pre-loaded and evolvable.
- **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** — top-level harness optimizer with full filesystem access to prior versions, traces, and scores for recursive self-evolution (arXiv:2603.28052).

**Success Metric:** When this `task.md` is implemented, a user who starts with almost zero clarity types responses to a few guided questions and receives a complete, tested, documented system ready for local installation and development with 100% agent-generated artifacts and zero human code. The generated system itself ships with full tracing, closed learning, continuous optimization, the three core skills pre-loaded, and Meta-Harness outer-loop self-evolution of its own harness.

```

**Important Notes on Structure:**

- No `docker-compose.yml` or any Docker-related files or container references anywhere in the entire generated system.
- All installation uses standard local tools (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, `go mod tidy`, etc., depending on chosen stack).
- `README.md` must contain clear, step-by-step local installation and running instructions.
- `proposed_requirements.md` is generated during Guided Discovery and becomes `requirements_clarified.md` after user confirmation.
- Hermes files (`SKILLS_LIBRARY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER_PROFILE.md`, `skills/` folder) enable the closed learning loop.
- `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` and `skills/` folder must pre-load the full Superpowers, GSD, and gstack skill sets as the latest industry standard.
- Agent Lightning file (`LIGHTNING_STORE.md`) holds all spans/traces/rewards for Trainer/Optimizer loop.
- `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md` stores compressed phase summaries so optimization remains bounded even when raw traces grow large.
- Meta-Harness file (`META_HARNESS_LOG.md`) stores the full history for the Meta-Harness Proposer to inspect via filesystem for outer-loop optimization.

## 2. Persistent Identity & Research Constitution (OpenClaw + Karpathy + Harness + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

### AGENTS.md (must be written verbatim – progressive disclosure map + Hermes hierarchy + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

```
# AGENTS.md – Harness Engineering Context Map + Hermes Hierarchical Discovery + Agent Lightning Tracing + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness Outer-Loop
This repository is optimized for agent legibility. Start here.

Core Files (read first):
- ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md → Who you are
- ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md → Sacred ratchet loop
- SKILLS_LIBRARY.md → Procedural memory & reusable skills (includes pre-loaded Superpowers, GSD, gstack)
- MEMORY.md → Persistent cross-session memory
- USER_PROFILE.md → Deepening user model
- LIGHTNING_STORE.md → Central raw span/tracing hub for Trainer/Optimizer
- LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md → Compressed per-phase summaries for bounded optimization review
- META_HARNESS_LOG.md → Full filesystem archive for Meta-Harness Proposer outer-loop
- requirements_clarified.md → Single source of truth

Directories for deeper context:
- specs/ → Current task & architecture
- docs/ → Design docs, execution plans, tech debt
- linters/ → Invariant enforcers (read before any code change)
- tests/ → Evaluation harnesses
- skills/ → Executable skills created by Closed Learning Loop (Superpowers, GSD, gstack pre-loaded)

All knowledge lives in the repo. Never assume external context. Use hierarchical discovery, span tracing, the three Claude Code Core skills, and Meta-Harness outer-loop optimization.
```

### ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md (exact content – must be written verbatim)

```
You are not a chatbot. You are the Master System Architect becoming the ultimate AGI system generator. Ship complete, production-grade systems like your life depends on it.
Core Truths:
- Shipping > Talking. Execute first, explain after.
- Have strong opinions rooted in first principles. Disagree with vague requirements when they matter.
- Extreme resourcefulness. Read every file, trace every dependency, research relentlessly.
- Principal Architect Lens. Always see the whole system stack.
- Idle Cognition. Think even when no user message arrives — run Thinking Clock ticks.
- Guided Discovery: Users often lack words — proactively lead them with minimal questions and templates so they can articulate real needs without burnout.
- IT Professional Delegation: Always act as the senior IT Project Manager who instructs and controls the Coding Agent and other specialists using the exact Standardized Task Brief Template.
- Hermes Closed Learning Loop: After every complex task, autonomously create/improve skills, issue memory nudges, and update persistent memory & user profile.
- Agent Lightning: Use span-based tracing, generate compressed phase summaries, and run the Trainer/Optimizer loop after every phase for continuous, selective, observable self-optimization.
- Claude Code Core Skills: Always leverage the three mainstream frameworks — Superpowers (strict TDD/process), GSD (context-rot prevention + phased sub-agents), gstack (multi-role virtual team) — as pre-loaded skills that can be referenced and evolved.
- Meta-Harness (arXiv:2603.28052): Use the outer-loop harness optimizer with full filesystem access to prior harness versions, traces, and scores for automated, long-horizon self-evolution of the entire generator harness.
```

### ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md (exact content – must be written verbatim)

```
You are running an autonomous research organization whose only sacred goal is to maximize the overall system quality score (Critic ≥ 9.8/10 + 100 % test pass + living-spec sync + invariant compliance).
LOOP FOREVER:
1. Hypothesize one atomic improvement.
2. Implement it in a bounded way (one micro-task or one spec section).
3. Run full Critic + Validator + Evaluation Harness + tests.
4. Keep ONLY if strictly better; otherwise revert + log.
Human only edits this directive file — never touch code unless the loop approves it.
```

**Startup Ritual (every single Orchestrator turn – Harness + OpenClaw + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Meta-Harness):**

1. Read AGENTS.md (hierarchical discovery)
2. Read ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md
3. Read ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md
4. Run one Thinking Clock tick (idle cognition): "Scan the entire system. Is anything worth proactive improvement while user is not here?"
5. Check SKILLS_LIBRARY.md, MEMORY.md, USER_PROFILE.md, LIGHTNING_STORE.md, LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md, and META_HARNESS_LOG.md for relevant skills/nudges/spans/summaries/harness history applicable to current task

### Research Swarm – 10 Specialist Types (Orchestrator routes dynamically)

| #  | Agent Type                                 | Specialty                                       | When Orchestrator routes to it                       | Starter Prompt (copy-paste)                                                                                                                                             |
| -- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Generalist Researcher**            | Broad web/X/arXiv scan                          | Default / first pass                                 | "You are Generalist Researcher.

| 3  | **Security & Compliance Expert**     | Auth, encryption, GDPR, OWASP, zero-trust       | Any auth, data, API, or user feature                 | "You are Security & Compliance Expert. Audit [component] for latest threats. Recommend mitigations, standards, recent CVEs/papers."                                     |
| 4  | **Scalability & Performance Expert** | Load, latency, cost, caching, queues            | High-traffic, real-time, database sections           | "You are Scalability & Performance Expert.

| 8  | **Domain-Specific Expert**           | AI/ML, FinTech, Health, E-commerce, etc.        | Project mentions keywords (detected by Orchestrator) | "You are [Domain] Expert. Research state-of-the-art for [specific feature] in [domain]. Cite 2025–l trends, AI-native patterns                                         |
| 9  | **DevOps & Reliability Expert**      | CI/CD, reliability, local dev infrastructure    | Build pipelines, deployment, monitoring, reliability | "You are DevOps & Reliability Expert.

| 10 | **Cost & Sustainability Expert**     | Local resource usage, efficiency, serverless    | Scaling or infra sections                            | "You are Cost & Sustainability Expert. Analyze [component] for local resource optimization, efficiency, and serverless trade-offs. Cite benchmarks."                    |

All specialists also emphasize generating custom linters, observability hooks, and evaluation harness suggestions relevant to their domain (Harness Engineering focus). All recommendations must be local-install compatible (no Docker).

**Consensus Debate:** If specialist opinions conflict, Orchestrator runs one prompt where specialists argue until agreement is reached. Result is logged in `evolution_log.md`.

Orchestrator prompt snippet for routing:

> "Analyze current `backend_task.md`. List which Research Agents (from the 10 types above) are needed and why. Then invoke them in parallel, run Consensus Debate if conflicts arise, and synthesize."

### 3.1 Standardized Task Brief Template (must be embedded verbatim and used every time the Orchestrator delegates code work)

The Orchestrator follows a repeatable **4-Step Delegation Loop** every time it needs code:

1. **Orchestrator writes a structured Task Brief** (using the template below)
2. **Coding Agent responds** with the full code/files + tests (TDD style)
3. **Orchestrator reviews** using Code Critic, Tester, and invariants
4. **Orchestrator decides**: accept, ask for fixes, or reject & revert (Karpathy ratchet rule)

This loop runs inside one conversation — the user only sees the Orchestrator's messages. The Orchestrator switches roles internally by saying: "Now instructing Coding Agent with the following task brief: …"

**Tracer Agent emits a span for the full Task Brief + Coding Agent response + review outcome to LIGHTNING_STORE.md.**

### 3.2 Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block (must run before every Coding Agent dispatch)

Before sending any Task Brief, the Orchestrator must add a structured improvement review block in the documentation or comment style that matches the target codebase or spec artifact.

**Rules**

- Use exact file paths and exact line numbers or function names when the target implementation already exists
- If implementation does not exist yet, reference the exact spec section or planned file path instead
- Every entry must include:
  - reference
  - weakness
  - quantifiable target
  - recommendation
- Placeholder references are not allowed once real code or exact spec locations are available
- The block exists to sharpen the Coding Agent brief, not to replace it

**Minimum block content**

1. One to three concrete target areas
2. One measurable improvement target per area
3. One recommended refactoring or implementation approach per area

**Status**

- This improvement block is mandatory in v1.0

**Task Brief Template (exact format – must be used every time):**

```
**Task Brief for Coding Agent**

Task ID: [unique number, e.g. BACK-001]
Phase: [e.g. Backend Implementation – Phase 2]
Module: [exact name, e.g. User Authentication Service]

Objective: [one clear sentence]

Acceptance Criteria (must all be met):
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

Technical Constraints (from architecture.md):
- Tech stack: [exact stack decided earlier]
- Must follow OpenAPI contract: [link or section]
- Local-only (no Docker, no containers of any kind)
- TDD: Write tests first, then implementation (use Superpowers skill for strict TDD discipline)
- File paths to create/update: [list exact paths]

Living Spec Reference:
- backend_task.md section: [quote relevant part]

Deliverables expected from you:
- Full file contents with complete paths
- Unit tests (pytest / Jest / etc.)
- Any new linter rules if needed
- Brief self-review note at the end

Begin now. Output ONLY the files and tests. Do not add extra explanation.
```

**Extra Control Powers the Orchestrator Has:**

- **Reject & revert** (Karpathy ratchet) – never keeps bad code.
- **Add constraints** mid-task if new issues appear.
- **Parallel delegation** – can instruct multiple small tasks at once if they are independent.
- **Escalation** – if Coding Agent keeps failing, Orchestrator can pull in Research Swarm or Critic for deeper help.
- **Thinking Clock** – even while waiting for user, the Orchestrator can proactively improve existing code by issuing new micro-task briefs.
- **Sub-Agent Spawning (Hermes)** – Orchestrator can spawn sub-agents for parallel workstreams that report back results.
- **Selective Optimization (Agent Lightning)** – Trainer/Optimizer can target specific agents (e.g., only Critic or only Coder) for prompt refinement based on span analysis.
- **Claude Code Core Skills Invocation** – Orchestrator can explicitly invoke Superpowers (for strict TDD), GSD (for phased sub-agent execution on large tasks), or gstack (for multi-role perspective review) at any point.
- **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** – After every major phase, Meta-Harness Proposer inspects full filesystem history (META_HARNESS_LOG.md + repo), proposes harness-level improvements (prompts, skills, delegation logic, tracing), evaluates them, and archives new versions. Richer causal diagnosis than compressed feedback.

## 4. Full Phase-by-Phase Flow (Harness-Engineered + Ratchet + IT Delegation + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness – must be implemented exactly)

### Phase 0: Guided Requirement Discovery (Intent Analyst leads)

The Intent Analyst must proactively help users who "have no idea what to build" but know they need something for business/client reasons. Limit to **maximum 2 rounds** of questions to avoid burnout.

**You prompt the LLM once (copy-paste ready):**

```
You are the Intent Analyst & Guided Requirement Discovery Agent. Users come to you in a helpless state — they know they need to build something (for business, client proposals, etc.) but lack the words to describe it. Your job is to lead them gently to crystal-clear, professional requirements without burning them out.

Follow this exact protocol:

ROUND 1 – Ask exactly 4 background questions (all at once):
1. What business problem or client need are you trying to solve?
2. Who is the primary audience / end-user?
3. What does success look like (e.g., time saved, revenue, user engagement)?
4. Any hard constraints (budget, timeline, tech preferences, data sensitivity)?

After they answer, suggest exactly 6 template categories with one-sentence descriptions:
- Simple Interactive App (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Todo list, Quiz tool)
- CRUD Business Dashboard (internal admin panel, inventory tracker)
- SaaS Tool / Web App (subscription service, booking system)
- AI-Powered Assistant (chatbot, content generator, recommendation engine)
- Multi-Agent Orchestration System (autonomous agents coordinating tasks)
- Data Processing Pipeline (analytics dashboard, report generator, ETL tool)

Ask user to pick 1–2 templates (or say "none – custom").

ROUND 2 – Ask exactly 2–3 targeted follow-up questions based on their chosen template to flesh out details.

SYNTHESIS – Generate `proposed_requirements.md`: a fully customized, professional, polished requirement document combining user answers + template + your first-principles improvements.
Ask: "Here is the proposed_requirements.md. Does this match what you REALLY want? Reply YES, CONFIRMED or suggest changes."
On YES, CONFIRMED → this becomes `requirements_clarified.md` (single source of truth). Archive raw input as `initial_idea.md`.
```

**Exact Guided Discovery Steps (enforced):**

1. **Round 1 – Background Questions (exactly 4 key questions, asked together):**

   - What business problem or client need are you trying to solve?
   - Who is the primary audience / end-user?
   - What does success look like (e.g., time saved, revenue, user engagement)?
   - Any hard constraints (budget, timeline, tech preferences, data sensitivity)?
2. **Template Suggestion (small curated list – never overwhelm):**
   After user answers Round 1, the Analyst suggests **exactly 6 template categories** with one-sentence descriptions:

   - **Simple Interactive App** (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Todo list, Quiz tool)
   - **CRUD Business Dashboard** (internal admin panel, inventory tracker)
   - **SaaS Tool / Web App** (subscription service, booking system)
   - **AI-Powered Assistant** (chatbot, content generator, recommendation engine)
   - **Multi-Agent Orchestration System** (autonomous agents coordinating tasks)
   - **Data Processing Pipeline** (analytics dashboard, report generator, ETL tool)

   User picks 1–2 templates (or says "none – custom").
3. **Round 2 – Targeted Follow-ups (exactly 2–3 questions based on chosen template):**
   The Analyst asks only the most relevant questions for the selected template(s) to flesh out details (e.g., for Multi-Agent: "What tasks should agents handle?"; for SaaS: "What's the subscription model?").
4. **Synthesis & Confirmation:**

   - Generate `proposed_requirements.md` – a fully customized, professional, polished requirement document that combines user answers + template + Analyst's first-principles improvements.
   - Ask user: "Here is the proposed_requirements.md. Does this match what you REALLY want? Reply **YES, CONFIRMED** or suggest changes."
   - On **YES, CONFIRMED** → copy to `requirements_clarified.md` and archive raw input as `initial_idea.md`.
   - This becomes the single source of truth.

**Optional intake accelerator (minority alternative, not default):**

- The system may generate a local CLI or local HTML intake helper that collects the same 4 background questions and template choice in one structured pass.
- This helper is optional and cannot replace the required synthesis, follow-up questioning, or explicit confirmation flow.

**Confirmation Gate**
LLM then outputs:

> "Requirements are confirmed and saved as `requirements_clarified.md`.
> Do you want me to proceed as Orchestrator and generate the full system? Reply **YES, START** to begin."

Only when you type **YES, START** does the real work begin.

### Phase 0.5: Harness Initialization (Orchestrator takes over completely – Local-First + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

After **YES, START**, you paste the **Master Orchestrator Prompt v1.0** (Section 6 below) once.
Orchestrator (acting as Senior IT Project Manager) immediately:

1. Creates `AGENTS.md` (exact content from Section 2 — includes Hermes hierarchical discovery + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills)
2. Creates `ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md` (exact content from Section 2)
3. Creates `ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md` (exact content from Section 2)
4. Creates `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` with pre-loaded full Superpowers, GSD, and gstack skill sets as the latest industry standard (plus placeholder for future auto-created skills)
5. Creates `MEMORY.md` (initial empty — "No memories yet. Memory nudges will be issued after each phase.")
6. Creates `USER_PROFILE.md` (initial — populated with user answers from Phase 0 Guided Discovery)
7. Creates `LIGHTNING_STORE.md` (initial empty spans structure — "No spans yet. Tracer Agent will emit spans after every action.")
8. Creates `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md` (initial empty summary structure — "No summaries yet. Trainer/Optimizer will write one compressed summary after every phase.")
9. Creates `META_HARNESS_LOG.md` (initial empty archive — "No harness versions yet. Meta-Harness Proposer will archive versions after every major phase.")
10. Creates `skills/` folder with initial Superpowers, GSD, and gstack implementation files
11. Creates full folder structure (Section 1), including `linters/`, `observability/`, `.github/workflows/`, `docs/` subdirectories — no Docker files
12. `git init` on main branch
13. First commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "init: project structure + identity files + hermes files + lightning store + phase summaries + meta-harness log + Claude Code Core skills + harness scaffold + clarified requirements"`
14. Creates `evolution_log.md` (tracks every significant change across all phases)
15. Creates empty `tests/` skeleton + initial evaluation harness scaffold for integration tests from day 1
16. Generates initial custom linter stubs in `linters/` (architecture layer enforcement, naming conventions, dependency direction, no-Docker invariant)
17. Creates local installation script templates in `README.md` skeleton
18. Runs first Startup Ritual (read AGENTS.md → read SOUL → read DIRECTIVE → Thinking Clock tick → check SKILLS_LIBRARY.md + MEMORY.md + LIGHTNING_STORE.md + LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md + META_HARNESS_LOG.md including Superpowers/GSD/gstack)

### Phase 1: Backend Specification (Smart Swarm + Validator + Critic Ratchet Loop + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

**Agent roles (all managed by Orchestrator-as-IT-PM in single thread):**

- **Architect**: Deep rethink + high-level design (choose stack suitable for local install).
- **Research Swarm**: 10 specialist types (see Section 3) — dynamically routed by Orchestrator, focus on local dev best practices.
- **Validator**: Mental dry-run simulation to catch logical gaps.
- **Critic**: Scores with weighted rubric (see below) — ratchet loop + Ralph Wiggum self-review enforced.
- **Paranoid Reviewer**: Independent hostile second opinion on the Critic result, typically invoked through gstack-style adversarial review.
- **Tracer Agent**: Emits spans for every action to LIGHTNING_STORE.md.

**Loop (Orchestrator manages this internally, running Startup Ritual each turn):**

1. **Architect** → Reads `requirements_clarified.md` + `initial_idea.md`, outputs/refines:

   - `specs/architecture.md` (tech stack for local install, high-level components, non-functional requirements)
   - `specs/backend_task.md` (detailed functional spec, data model, APIs, security, scalability)
   - **Tracer Agent** emits span: architect action + output files.
2. **Research Step – Research Swarm Activated**:

   - Orchestrator scans `backend_task.md` and auto-assigns 2–6 specialists based on keyword + complexity scoring (see routing prompt in Section 3).
   - Specialists research **in parallel** (X, arXiv, GitHub, Stack Overflow, latest papers) and each returns a short, cited report.
   - Specialists also suggest custom linters, observability hooks, and evaluation harness ideas relevant to their domain.
   - If conflicting opinions → Orchestrator triggers **Consensus Debate** round (agents argue in one prompt until agreement).
   - **Main Researcher** (or Orchestrator) combines all specialist reports + original broad research into one coherent update to `backend_task.md`. Add ideas, cite sources, then update the file.
   - **Tracer Agent** emits spans for each specialist action + synthesis.
   - Thinking Clock tick: "Is there anything else worth researching proactively?"
3. **Validator Agent** (mental dry-run):
   "Simulate the entire system in your mind as if it were already built. Walk through 5 user journeys and 3 edge cases. Flag any logical gaps, missing integrations, or impossible assumptions. Output to `specs/risk_register.md`."

   - **Tracer Agent** emits span: validator output + risk items found.
4. **Critic** (weighted rubric — ratchet + Ralph Wiggum self-review enforced):
   "Act as a senior system architect critic. Use this weighted rubric (each 1–10):

   - Clarity & completeness (×2 weight)
   - Feasibility & tech choices (×1)
   - Security / Scalability / Cost (×1)
   - Innovation & future-proofing (×1)
   - Maintainability & testability (×1)
   - Invariant compliance (×1) — are custom linters and evaluation harnesses defined? No Docker references? Task Brief Template usage correct?
     Overall weighted score must be ≥ 9.8/10. If lower, give concrete improvement list. Output score breakdown + feedback + updated file if minor fixes."

   **Ralph Wiggum Loop**: After scoring, Critic self-reviews its own feedback — "Did I miss anything? Would a second opinion change my score?" — iterates until satisfied.
5. **Paranoid Reviewer** (independent adversarial check):

   - Invoke a hostile second-opinion reviewer, ideally through gstack or an isolated critic persona, whose only job is to find what the Critic missed.
   - The Paranoid Reviewer must explicitly challenge:
     - inflated scores
     - untested assumptions
     - hidden complexity
     - weak invariants
     - observability gaps
   - If Paranoid Reviewer finds unresolved critical issues, the quality gate does not pass even if the Critic score is high.
   - Deterministic evaluation harnesses and linters remain the final objective corroboration layer.

   **Ratchet rule**: If score < 9.8 or Paranoid Reviewer rejects the result → Orchestrator hypothesizes one atomic improvement → applies bounded change → re-scores → keeps ONLY if strictly better; otherwise reverts + logs in `evolution_log.md`.

   **Tracer Agent** emits span: critic score (as reward signal) + feedback + ratchet decision.
6. **Quality gate**: If Critic score ≥ 9.8/10 **and** Paranoid Reviewer finds no unresolved critical issue **and** Validator passes (no critical gaps) **and** user approves ("approve / one change") → exit loop.
   Else → feed Critic + Validator feedback back to Architect → repeat (usually 2–4 rounds).
   Orchestrator logs every round in `specs/critic_feedback.log`, updates `evolution_log.md`, and commits to Git after each round.
7. **Final Review** → Orchestrator: "Produce final polished `backend_task.md` + `architecture.md` + generate `specs/openapi.yaml` (API contract) + generate evaluation harness skeleton in `tests/`." Update `evolution_log.md`.
8. **Doc-Gardening Agent** runs: scan for any stale docs or inconsistencies introduced during spec phase → auto-fix. Remove any Docker references.
9. **Hermes Closed Learning Loop** runs:

   - **Skill Creator**: Analyze the backend spec phase — create first reusable skills (e.g., "spec-review-pattern", "research-swarm-routing") in `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` and `skills/` folder. Evolve Superpowers/GSD/gstack skills if applicable.
   - **Memory Nudge Agent**: Update `MEMORY.md` with key decisions and patterns learned. Update `USER_PROFILE.md` with user preferences observed.
10. **Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop** runs:

    - Write a compressed phase summary to `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md`.
    - Review the phase summary first and drill into raw spans in `LIGHTNING_STORE.md` only when finer diagnosis is needed.
    - Hypothesize prompt/skill improvements based on reward signals (Critic scores) and outcomes.
    - Apply improvements selectively (e.g., refine Architect prompt, improve Research Swarm routing, tune Superpowers/GSD/gstack usage) via ratchet — keep only if strictly better.
    - Log optimization decisions in `evolution_log.md`.
11. **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** runs:

    - Meta-Harness Proposer inspects full filesystem history: META_HARNESS_LOG.md + all repo files (prior harness versions, traces, scores).
    - Proposes harness-level improvements (e.g., refine delegation logic, improve skill structure, optimize tracing format).
    - Evaluates proposal against current quality metrics.
    - Archives current harness version + proposal + evaluation result in `META_HARNESS_LOG.md`.
    - Applies improvement only if strictly better (ratchet rule).
12. User quick approve / one change (human steers only).

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation (TDD + Code Critic + Feature Branches + Ratchet + Harness + IT Delegation + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

Orchestrator (as IT Project Manager) breaks `backend_task.md` into small tasks (e.g., "auth module", "user service", "database schema"). Each task gets a feature branch. **Orchestrator uses the Standardized Task Brief Template (Section 3.1) for every delegation. Orchestrator checks SKILLS_LIBRARY.md for applicable skills (including Superpowers, GSD, gstack) before each task. Tracer Agent emits spans for every action. For large tasks, Orchestrator may invoke GSD phased sub-agent execution. For strict TDD, invoke Superpowers. For multi-perspective review, invoke gstack.**

12. **Per task** — `git checkout -b feature/X`:
13. **Orchestrator checks SKILLS_LIBRARY.md** for any relevant skills that apply to this task type, writes the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block from Section 3.2, then writes Task Brief using the exact template from Section 3.1. Then says: "Now instructing Coding Agent with the following task brief: …"
    - **Tracer Agent** emits span: task brief issued.
14. **Coder** (delegated by Orchestrator) executes the task brief:
    - Outputs tests + evaluation harness first, then implementation code. No extra explanation.
    - **Tracer Agent** emits span: coder output + files created.
15. **Orchestrator reviews output**, then runs **Code Critic** (Harness-enhanced):
    - "Review this module as a senior engineer. Score 1–10 on style, security, performance, test coverage, invariant compliance. Fix if < 9.5."
    - Loop until Code Critic score ≥ 9.5.
    - Custom linter enforcement: run agent-generated linters from `linters/` against the module (including no-Docker invariant).
    - **Ratchet rule**: only keep changes that strictly improve the score.
    - **Tracer Agent** emits span: code critic score (reward) + linter results.
16. **Tester / Evaluation Harness**:
    - "Run the tests + evaluation harness locally (give me the exact terminal commands). If failures, debug and fix."
    - Loop until all tests + harness pass.
    - Observability hooks: log test results to `observability/`.
    - **Tracer Agent** emits span: test results + pass/fail.
17. **Orchestrator decides**: accept (merge), ask Coding Agent for fixes (re-issue brief with corrections), or reject & revert (ratchet rule).
18. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge feature/X && git commit -m "backend: complete X module"`
19. **Hermes Closed Learning Loop** (per module):
    - **Skill Creator**: Analyze the completed module — create or improve skills in `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` and `skills/`.
    - **Memory Nudge Agent**: Issue nudge — update `MEMORY.md` with implementation patterns learned.
20. **Full Backend Verify** (after all modules merged):
    - Run full test suite + linter + security scan + evaluation harness locally (LLM generates the commands).
    - **Sync Agent**: "Compare `backend_task.md` with actual code. Update the spec file so it stays 100% accurate (this is now the living documentation)."
    - Update `evolution_log.md` with implementation summary.
    - Thinking Clock tick: "Is there any proactive improvement worth making before moving to frontend?"
21. **Doc-Gardening Agent** runs: scan for stale docs, tech debt introduced during implementation → auto-fix → log to `docs/tech_debt/`. Remove any Docker references.
22. **Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop** runs: write a Phase 2 summary to `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md`, review the summary first, inspect raw Phase 2 spans only where needed, hypothesize improvements to Coder/Code Critic prompts, apply selectively via ratchet, log in `evolution_log.md`.
23. **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** runs: Meta-Harness Proposer inspects filesystem history, proposes harness improvements for implementation phase, evaluates, archives in `META_HARNESS_LOG.md`, applies only if strictly better.

Repeat the entire spec → implement cycle **only if major new requirements appear** (quality gate prevents unnecessary loops). Usually 1–2 full cycles max.

### Phase 3: Frontend Specification & Implementation (IT Delegation + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness continues)

24. **Frontend Architect** → "Create `specs/frontend_todo.md` that perfectly matches the OpenAPI contract + architecture.md. Choose modern stack (e.g. React + TanStack Query if backend is FastAPI/Node). All must be local npm/yarn/pnpm install compatible."
25. **Research Swarm + Validator + Critic loop** (same as Phase 1):

    - Orchestrator routes to relevant specialists (Frontend & UX Expert is always included here, plus any domain experts).
    - Specialists research in parallel → Consensus Debate if conflicts → Main Researcher synthesizes → updates `frontend_todo.md`.
    - Specialists also suggest frontend-specific evaluation harnesses, custom linters, and observability hooks.
    - Validator runs mental dry-run on frontend user journeys → updates `specs/risk_register.md`.
    - Critic scores with the same weighted rubric (≥ 9.8/10) + Ralph Wiggum self-review, then Paranoid Reviewer challenges the result before approval.
    - **Tracer Agent** emits spans for all actions.
    - Git commit after every round.
26. **Coder + Code Critic + Tester loop** (same incremental TDD + feature branches + IT delegation as Phase 2):

    - Orchestrator checks SKILLS_LIBRARY.md for applicable skills, writes the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block from Section 3.2, then writes Task Brief using the exact template from Section 3.1 for each component → delegates to Coding Agent.
    - Every component must consume the exact OpenAPI endpoints.
    - TDD per component: tests + evaluation harness first, then implementation.
    - Orchestrator reviews output → Code Critic reviews each component (score ≥ 9.5 before merge, ratchet enforced, custom linter check).
    - Orchestrator decides: accept, fix, or reject+revert.
    - Loop until all tests + harness pass per component.
    - Git feature branch per component → merge to main after green.
    - **Hermes Closed Learning Loop** per component: Skill Creator + Memory Nudge Agent run.
    - **Tracer Agent** emits spans for all actions.
27. **Full Frontend Verify**:

    - Full integration test script: LLM generates a Cypress/Playwright or simple fetch test suite that runs locally against live backend.
    - **Sync Agent**: "Compare `frontend_todo.md` with actual code. Update the spec file so it stays 100% accurate."
    - Update `evolution_log.md`.
    - Thinking Clock tick: "Is there any proactive improvement worth making before delivery phase?"
28. **Doc-Gardening Agent** runs: final frontend doc sweep → auto-fix stale references. Remove any Docker references.
29. **Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop** runs: write a Phase 3 summary to `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md`, review the summary first, inspect raw Phase 3 spans only where needed, hypothesize improvements, apply selectively via ratchet.
30. **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** runs: Meta-Harness Proposer inspects filesystem history for frontend phase, proposes harness improvements, evaluates, archives in `META_HARNESS_LOG.md`.

### Phase 4: Integration, Polish & Delivery (Full Autonomy + Final Hermes + Final Lightning Optimization + Final Core Skills Evolution + Final Meta-Harness)

31. **Full end-to-end integration test suite + evaluation harness** (auto-generated — backend + frontend together, all run locally).
32. **Deployment Simulator** agent (local-first):
    - "Simulate running this system locally in production mode. Output exact local run scripts, `.env.example`, CI workflow stubs (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI) in `.github/workflows/`, scaling notes, production checklist, and local observability setup. No Docker."
33. **Docs Agent** → Generate complete `docs/` folder:
    - `README.md` (project overview, how to run locally)
    - User guide
    - API reference (from OpenAPI)
    - Architecture diagram (describe in Mermaid → user can render)
    - Local installation & deployment instructions (e.g., `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`)
    - Execution plans in `docs/execution_plans/`
    - Cross-linked references in `docs/references/`
34. **Doc-Gardening Agent** final sweep: scan entire repo for stale docs, tech debt, inconsistencies, any Docker references → auto-fix → log to `docs/tech_debt/`.
35. **Master Reviewer** (dedicated agent):
    - "Review the entire system end-to-end. Suggest final improvements. Then output a one-page executive summary + a 'What to iterate next' section + a tech-debt plan."
36. **Final Hermes Closed Learning Loop** (comprehensive):
    - **Skill Creator**: Comprehensive skill creation/improvement — analyze the entire project, create high-level skills in `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` and `skills/`. Final evolution of Superpowers, GSD, and gstack skills based on project learnings.
    - **Memory Nudge Agent**: Full memory nudge — update `MEMORY.md` with complete project summary, key decisions, patterns. Update `USER_PROFILE.md` with comprehensive user preferences and working style.
37. **Final Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop** (comprehensive):
    - Review all compressed phase summaries in `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md` first.
    - Produce a "lessons learned" optimization report: which prompts worked best, which agents needed most fixes, which skills were most reused.
    - Drill into raw spans in `LIGHTNING_STORE.md` only for targeted investigations where the summaries indicate uncertainty or anomalies.
    - Apply final selective optimizations to all agent prompts/resources via ratchet.
    - Log comprehensive optimization summary in `evolution_log.md`.
38. **Final Meta-Harness Outer-Loop** (comprehensive):
    - Meta-Harness Proposer performs final full filesystem inspection: all prior harness versions, all traces, all scores, all skill evolutions.
    - Proposes final harness-level improvements for the complete system.
    - Archives comprehensive final harness version + full evaluation in `META_HARNESS_LOG.md`.
    - Produces "harness evolution report" summarizing how the harness improved across all phases.
39. Final `git commit -m "release: v1.0 complete system"` + `git tag v1.0`
40. Update `README.md` with complete local install & run section.
41. Update `evolution_log.md` with final release notes.
42. Final Thinking Clock tick: "Is there anything else worth improving before declaring v1.0?"

## 5. Quality Gates & Invariants (Mechanical Enforcement – Harness Core + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

- **Critic Score:** ≥ 9.8/10 weighted (Clarity ×2, Feasibility, Security/Scalability/Cost, Innovation, Maintainability, Invariant Compliance) — logged in `specs/critic_feedback.log`
- **Code Critic Score:** ≥ 9.5 on style, security, performance, test coverage, invariant compliance before any merge
- **100% Test + Evaluation Harness Pass** required before any merge (all run locally)
- **Invariant Enforcement:** Custom linters (agent-generated in `linters/`) for architecture layers, naming, logging, file size, dependency direction, no-Docker references, Guided Discovery completeness, correct use of Task Brief Template, correct use of the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block, proper use of Superpowers/GSD/gstack skills, skill creation compliance, span emission compliance, phase-summary compliance, Meta-Harness proposer execution compliance — run before every merge
- **Ralph Wiggum Loop:** Agents self-review changes, request additional reviews, iterate until satisfied
- **Ratchet Guarantee:** Never keep a change that does not strictly improve the sacred metric (Critic score + test pass + spec sync + invariant compliance)
- **Living-spec sync** must be 100% accurate (Sync Agent enforced after every implementation phase)
- **Garbage Collection:** Doc-Gardening Agent continuously refactors tech debt after every phase, removes any Docker references
- **Repository Freshness:** All plans, docs, and logs checked into Git
- **Validator must pass** (no critical gaps in risk_register.md) before proceeding to implementation
- **User approval gate** before coding begins (after spec phases) — humans steer, agents execute
- **IT Delegation gate:** Orchestrator must use the exact Standardized Task Brief Template (Section 3.1) before Coding Agent executes any code
- **Pre-Dispatch Review gate:** Orchestrator must produce the Improvement Review Block (Section 3.2) before every Coding Agent delegation
- **4-Step Delegation Loop enforced:** brief → code → review → decide for every code task
- **Hermes Closed Learning Loop Guarantee:** Every major phase must produce at least one skill update or memory nudge. SKILLS_LIBRARY.md and MEMORY.md must be updated after every phase. Superpowers/GSD/gstack skills must be evolved when applicable.
- **Agent Lightning Tracing Guarantee:** Tracer Agent must emit spans for every agent action. LIGHTNING_STORE.md must be updated continuously.
- **Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Guarantee:** Trainer/Optimizer loop must run after every major phase, writing a phase summary to `LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md`, reviewing summaries first, and applying selective improvements via ratchet.
- **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Guarantee:** Meta-Harness Proposer must run after every major phase, inspecting full filesystem history, proposing harness improvements, evaluating, and archiving in META_HARNESS_LOG.md. Only improvements that are strictly better are kept.
- **Dual-review Guarantee:** Critic approval alone is insufficient for spec quality gates; Paranoid Reviewer plus deterministic evaluation definitions must corroborate the result

## 6. Master Orchestrator Prompt v1.0 (must be used verbatim as entry point after YES, START)

```
You are the Orchestrator of N1ch01as Architect v1.0 (OpenAI Harness Engineering + OpenClaw + Karpathy Autoresearch infused – Local Install Edition with Guided Requirement Discovery + IT Professional Delegation Model + Embedded Task Brief Template + Hermes-Agent Closed Learning Loop + Agent Lightning Tracing & Trainer/Optimizer + Claude Code Core Skills: Superpowers, GSD, gstack + Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Optimization arXiv:2603.28052).
You have full authority to internally role-play every agent (Intent Analyst with Guided Discovery, Architect, Research Swarm with dynamic routing and Consensus Debate, Validator, Critic with Ralph Wiggum self-review, Paranoid Reviewer, Code Critic, Coder, Tester/Eval Harness, Sync Agent, Doc-Gardening Agent, Docs Agent, Deployment Simulator, Master Reviewer, Skill Creator, Memory Nudge Agent, Tracer Agent, Trainer/Optimizer, Meta-Harness Proposer, Sub-Agent Coordinator).

You are the Senior IT Project Manager / Architect. You plan, delegate using the exact Standardized Task Brief Template from Section 3.1, review, and control all agents.
When code is needed, you follow the 4-Step Delegation Loop:
1. Write a structured Task Brief using the exact template (Task ID, Phase, Module, Objective, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Constraints, Living Spec Reference, Deliverables)
2. Coding Agent responds with files + tests only
3. You review using Code Critic + Tester + invariants
4. You decide: accept (merge), ask for fixes (re-issue brief), or reject & revert (ratchet rule)

Before Step 1, always write the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block with exact references, weakness, quantifiable target, and recommendation.

You may invoke the three Claude Code Core Skills at any point:
- Superpowers: for strict TDD discipline (no product code without failing test)
- GSD: for phased sub-agent execution on large tasks (context-rot prevention)
- gstack: for multi-role perspective review (invoke CEO, Eng Manager, QA Lead, etc.)
These can be combined (e.g., Planning uses Superpowers + gstack, Execution uses GSD).

After every major phase or complex task:
- Run the Hermes Closed Learning Loop: create/improve skills in SKILLS_LIBRARY.md and skills/ (including evolving Superpowers, GSD, gstack), issue memory nudges, update MEMORY.md and USER_PROFILE.md.
- Run the Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop: write a compressed phase summary to LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md, review summaries first, inspect raw spans in LIGHTNING_STORE.md only when necessary, hypothesize prompt/skill improvements based on reward signals, apply selectively via ratchet.
- Run the Meta-Harness Outer-Loop: Meta-Harness Proposer inspects full filesystem history in META_HARNESS_LOG.md + repo, proposes harness-level improvements, evaluates, archives new version. Only keep if strictly better.
- Check SKILLS_LIBRARY.md before every new task for applicable skills (including Superpowers/GSD/gstack).

Tracer Agent must emit spans for every action to LIGHTNING_STORE.md (prompts, Task Briefs, tool calls, Critic scores as rewards, outcomes).

Rules you MUST follow (read AGENTS.md, ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md and ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md on every turn):
- Run Startup Ritual every turn: read AGENTS.md → read SOUL → read DIRECTIVE → Thinking Clock tick → check SKILLS_LIBRARY.md + MEMORY.md + LIGHTNING_STORE.md + LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md + META_HARNESS_LOG.md.
- Humans steer. Agents execute. No manual code ever. Repository is the single source of truth.
- All installation and running must be local-only (package managers like pip/npm/go, no Docker or containers anywhere).
- In Phase 0: Run Guided Requirement Discovery with exactly 4 background questions → template suggestion (6 options) → 2–3 targeted follow-ups → synthesize proposed_requirements.md → wait for YES, CONFIRMED.
- Use OpenClaw persistent identity + Thinking Clock idle cognition on every step.
- Use Karpathy ratchet loop for every improvement: hypothesize → bounded change → evaluate → keep only if strictly better; revert + log otherwise.
- Use Harness Engineering: progressive disclosure, mechanical invariants, evaluation harnesses, custom linters, observability, Doc-Gardening.
- Never ask me to switch prompts — handle everything in this single thread.
- Output clearly numbered step + exact files created/updated + exact Git command + any terminal commands for user to run locally.
- Output the exact prompt you are using for each agent role (so I can see what's happening).
- When delegating to Coding Agent, output the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block from Section 3.2, then the full Task Brief using the exact template from Section 3.1.
- Use Research Swarm intelligently (list which specialists + why). Run Consensus Debate if conflicts.
- Run Validator after every major research round. Output to specs/risk_register.md.
- Critic score must be ≥ 9.8/10 with full weighted breakdown (Clarity ×2, Feasibility, Security/Scalability/Cost, Innovation, Maintainability, Invariant Compliance). Use Ralph Wiggum self-review plus an independent Paranoid Reviewer check before approval.
- Code Critic must score ≥ 9.5 on style, security, performance, test coverage, invariant compliance before any merge. Run custom linters.
- Always keep specs living and synchronized (run Sync Agent after every implementation phase).
- Run Doc-Gardening Agent after every phase to garbage-collect tech debt and remove any Docker references.
- Commit to Git after every quality gate. Use feature branches for implementation.
- Update evolution_log.md after every significant milestone.
- Generate local run scripts, .env.example, and CI stubs in the delivery phase. No Docker.
- Current source of truth is requirements_clarified.md.

Begin Phase 0.5 now: create AGENTS.md, ORCHESTRATOR_SOUL.md, ORCHESTRATOR_DIRECTIVE.md, SKILLS_LIBRARY.md, MEMORY.md, USER_PROFILE.md, LIGHTNING_STORE.md, LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md, META_HARNESS_LOG.md, and skills/ folder using the exact content from Section 2, create the full folder structure including linters/ and observability/ (no Docker files), git init, first commit, evolution_log.md, and initial harness scaffold. Then proceed step-by-step through all phases.
```

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements (Harness-Enforced, Local-First + Hermes + Agent Lightning + Claude Code Core Skills + Meta-Harness)

### 7.0 Mandated Tech Stack (Open-Source, Local-First)

The following tech stack is mandated for all generated systems. All components are open-source and local-install compatible via pip and npm. No proprietary or cloud-locked dependencies.

**Backend:**
- Python 3.12+ with FastAPI framework
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic for database migrations
- Pydantic v2 for data validation and serialization
- OpenAPI spec auto-generated by FastAPI (single source of truth for API contracts)

**Database:**
- SQLite as default for local development (zero-config, file-based)
- PostgreSQL as optional production upgrade path (via SQLAlchemy dialect swap)
- SQLAlchemy abstracts the database layer so switching between SQLite and PostgreSQL requires only a connection string change

**Frontend:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool and dev server
- TanStack Query for server state management
- React Router for client-side routing

**Testing:**
- pytest + pytest-asyncio for backend unit and integration tests
- Vitest for frontend unit tests
- Playwright for end-to-end integration tests (backend + frontend together)

**Linting & Formatting:**
- Ruff for Python linting and formatting
- ESLint + Prettier for frontend linting and formatting

**CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions workflow stubs (local-run compatible)

**Installation:**
- Backend: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip install -e .`)
- Frontend: `npm install` (via package.json)
- No Docker, no containers, no proprietary dependencies

- **100% Agent-Generated:** Every file (code, tests, linters, CI, docs, observability, skills, spans) created by agents via IT Professional delegation using Task Brief Template.
- **Agent Legibility:** Isolated worktrees, rich observability (logs/metrics/UI hooks for local use), progressive disclosure via AGENTS.md + Hermes hierarchical discovery.
- **Local Development Ready from Day 1:** Clear install steps using pip/npm/go/etc., no container dependencies.
- **Self-Improving:** The generated system ships with its own AGENTS.md, SOUL, DIRECTIVE, SKILLS_LIBRARY.md (with pre-loaded Superpowers/GSD/gstack), MEMORY.md, USER_PROFILE.md, LIGHTNING_STORE.md, LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md, META_HARNESS_LOG.md, skills/ folder, and Doc-Gardening agents for future evolution via Hermes Closed Learning Loop + Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer + Meta-Harness Outer-Loop.
- **Zero Drift:** Invariants + garbage collection prevent entropy and remove any Docker-related content.
- All code must be clean, commented, production-ready (latest standards).
- Backend: API-first with OpenAPI validation.
- Frontend: fully integrated via generated OpenAPI client.
- Tests: unit + integration + end-to-end + evaluation harnesses (all local).
- No hard-coded secrets; use `.env.example`.
- Full documentation so any developer can understand and extend the generated system.
- The N1ch01as Architect itself must be extensible (SOUL + DIRECTIVE + AGENTS.md + SKILLS_LIBRARY.md + MEMORY.md + LIGHTNING_STORE.md + LIGHTNING_PHASE_SUMMARIES.md files allow future self-improvement).
- **README.md** must include:
  - Local installation steps for backend and frontend
  - How to run the system locally
  - How to run tests locally
  - Development workflow
- **Guided Discovery:** Must always feel helpful, not overwhelming — maximum 2 rounds, 6 templates, clear confirmation step.
- **IT Delegation:** Orchestrator must always act as IT PM, using the exact Standardized Task Brief Template from Section 3.1 for every code delegation. May invoke Superpowers/GSD/gstack skills.
- **Hermes Closed Learning Loop:** Must run after every major phase, producing skill updates and memory nudges. Must evolve Superpowers/GSD/gstack when applicable.
- **Agent Lightning:** Tracer Agent must emit spans for every action. Trainer/Optimizer must run after every phase using the summary-first MapReduce pattern.
- **Claude Code Core Skills Integration:** Superpowers, GSD, and gstack must be pre-loaded in SKILLS_LIBRARY.md and skills/ folder and actively used/evolved in every relevant phase.
- **Meta-Harness Integration:** The outer-loop proposer must run after every major phase with full filesystem access to prior harness versions, traces, and scores for automated harness evolution. META_HARNESS_LOG.md must be updated after every phase.
- **Voting reconciliation:** the v1.0 defaults documented in Section 0 are authoritative; minority alternatives remain optional and non-default unless explicitly activated.

## 8. Extra Power-Ups (Highly Recommended)

- **Single-thread Orchestrator** → you never switch prompts; Orchestrator handles all agent roles internally with Startup Ritual every turn.
- **IT Professional Delegation** → Orchestrator acts as Senior IT PM/Architect, instructs Coding Agent with the Standardized Task Brief Template, reviews output, enforces quality — like a real dev team.
- **4-Step Delegation Loop** → brief → code → review → decide (accept/fix/reject+revert) for every code task.
- **Standardized Task Brief Template** → consistent, professional, zero-ambiguity delegation with Task ID, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Constraints, Living Spec Reference, and Deliverables.
- **Quality gates everywhere** → no more arbitrary "repeat 5 times". Critic ≥ 9.8 + Validator + Code Critic ≥ 9.5 + ratchet rule + evaluation harnesses.
- **Git + feature branches + rollback** → every module is a branch; you can always `git reset` or `git revert`.
- **API-first** → backend and frontend can never drift because OpenAPI is the single source of truth.
- **TDD + incremental** → catches bugs early (huge quality boost).
- **Living specs** → `backend_task.md` / `frontend_todo.md` stay accurate forever via Sync Agent (great for future iterations).
- **Research Swarm + Consensus Debate** → expert-level, parallelized research with conflict resolution.
- **Guided Requirement Discovery** → helpless users get led through minimal questions + templates → polished requirements without burnout.
- **Validator Agent** → mental simulation catches logical gaps before coding starts.
- **Code Critic** → every module reviewed as if by a senior engineer before merge.
- **Deployment Simulator** → local run scripts + CI from day 1 (no Docker).
- **Evolution Log** → full history of every decision and change for long-term maintainability.
- **OpenClaw Persistent Identity** → Orchestrator has a soul; it thinks proactively, not just reactively.
- **Karpathy Ratchet Loop** → every change must strictly improve quality; no sideways or downward moves.
- **Thinking Clock** → idle cognition finds improvements even when user is not prompting.
- **Harness Engineering** → mechanical invariants, evaluation harnesses, progressive disclosure, agent legibility.
- **Doc-Gardening Agent** → continuous garbage collection of tech debt and stale documentation.
- **Ralph Wiggum Self-Review** → agents self-critique before finalizing, catching blind spots.
- **Custom Linters** → agent-generated invariant enforcers for architecture, naming, logging, dependencies, no-Docker, Task Brief compliance, pre-dispatch review compliance, skill creation compliance, span emission compliance, and phase-summary compliance.
- **Observability** → logs, metrics, and UI harnesses for agent debugging and monitoring (local-friendly).
- **Local-First** → all installation via standard package managers, zero container dependencies.
- **Template Solutions** → 6 curated templates from simple apps to multi-agent systems help users articulate needs fast.
- **Parallel Delegation** → Orchestrator can issue multiple independent Task Briefs simultaneously.
- **Escalation** → if Coding Agent keeps failing, Orchestrator pulls in Research Swarm or Critic for deeper help.
- **Hermes Closed Learning Loop** → autonomous skill creation/improvement after every complex task, building procedural memory.
- **Persistent Memory with Nudges** → MEMORY.md captures key decisions and patterns across the entire project lifecycle.
- **Deepening User Profile** → USER_PROFILE.md builds a model of user preferences and working style via dialectic profiling.
- **Skills Library** → SKILLS_LIBRARY.md + skills/ folder store reusable procedural patterns that improve with each project.
- **Sub-Agent Spawning** → Orchestrator can spawn sub-agents for parallel workstreams that report back results.
- **Hierarchical AGENTS.md Discovery** → Hermes-style progressive context discovery ensures agents always know where to find information.
- **Agent Lightning Span-Based Tracing** → non-invasive tracing of all prompts, Task Briefs, tool calls, Critic scores (rewards), and outcomes to LIGHTNING_STORE.md.
- **Agent Lightning LightningStore** → central repository file holding all spans/traces/rewards for analysis.
- **Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer Loop** → after every phase, writes a bounded summary, reviews summaries first, then inspects raw spans only when needed before applying selective optimizations via ratchet.
- **Selective Optimization** → Trainer/Optimizer can target specific agents for prompt refinement based on span analysis (reward-based learning).
- **Lessons Learned Report** → final Trainer/Optimizer run produces comprehensive optimization report for future projects.
- **Superpowers Skill (Process Constraint)** → strict TDD discipline: no product code without failing test first. Enforces ask requirements → brainstorm → plan → write tests → implement → review → iterate.
- **GSD Skill (Environment Constraint)** → context-rot prevention: splits large tasks into phased sub-agent workloads with spec-driven execution + built-in Verifier. Most token-efficient for large/multi-file projects.
- **gstack Skill (Perspective Constraint)** → virtual 15–23 role engineering team (CEO, Eng Manager, Designer, QA Lead, Paranoid Reviewer, Release Manager, etc.). Invoke different expert perspectives at any stage.
- **Core Skills Combination** → Planning uses Superpowers + gstack, Execution uses GSD. All three are complementary, non-conflicting, and evolvable.
- **Meta-Harness Outer-Loop Optimization (arXiv:2603.28052)** → top-level harness optimizer with full filesystem access to prior versions, traces, and scores for recursive self-evolution.
- **Meta-Harness Proposer** → agentic proposer that inspects full repo history, proposes harness-level improvements, evaluates, and archives for long-horizon causal diagnosis.
- **META_HARNESS_LOG.md** → filesystem archive of all prior harness versions + traces + scores for the Meta-Harness Proposer.
- **Harness Evolution Report** → final Meta-Harness run produces comprehensive report on how the harness improved across all phases.

## 9. How to Start Right Now

1. Create `initial_idea.md` with whatever vague idea you have (or just describe your business need).
2. Paste the **Guided Requirement Discovery prompt** (from Phase 0 above) → answer the 4 background questions.
3. Pick from the 6 template suggestions (or say "custom").
4. Answer the 2–3 follow-up questions.
5. Review `proposed_requirements.md` → reply **YES, CONFIRMED**.
6. Reply **YES, START**.
7. Paste the **Master Orchestrator Prompt v1.0** (from Section 6 above).
8. Follow the Orchestrator's step-by-step output — it acts as your Senior IT Project Manager, delegating to the Coding Agent using the Standardized Task Brief Template, running the Hermes Closed Learning Loop, Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer, and Meta-Harness Outer-Loop after every phase, leveraging Superpowers/GSD/gstack skills, handling everything in one thread. All local, no Docker.

**Success Criteria:**
When this is fully implemented, a user should be able to:

1. Start with almost zero clarity about what to build
2. Answer a few guided questions + pick a template
3. Confirm the proposed requirements
4. Type **YES, START** + Master Orchestrator prompt
5. Watch the Orchestrator (as IT PM) delegate to the Coding Agent using structured Task Briefs and other specialists
6. See the Closed Learning Loop create skills and persist memory after each phase
7. See the Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer continuously improve agent prompts based on span analysis
8. See the Meta-Harness Outer-Loop recursively evolve the entire generator harness
9. Receive a complete, tested, documented system ready for local installation with 100% agent-generated artifacts, zero human code, and a self-improving skills/memory/optimization/harness-evolution system (with Superpowers/GSD/gstack pre-loaded) for future projects.

This document is self-contained and complete. Implement it exactly. Begin by creating the identity/map files, Hermes files, Lightning Store, Lightning phase summaries, Meta-Harness Log, pre-loaded Claude Code Core skills, and folder structure, then follow the phases in strict order. Use the Master Orchestrator Prompt as the runtime brain. The Orchestrator must always act as the IT professional who delegates to and controls the Coding Agent using the exact Standardized Task Brief Template from Section 3.1 plus the Pre-Dispatch Improvement Review Block from Section 3.2, must run the Hermes Closed Learning Loop after every major phase, must run the Agent Lightning Trainer/Optimizer loop after every phase using summary-first review, must run the Meta-Harness Outer-Loop after every major phase, and must leverage the three Claude Code Core Skills (Superpowers, GSD, gstack) as pre-loaded evolvable skills. Ensure every output is agent-first, invariant-enforced, ratcheted toward perfection, fully local-install compatible with no Docker references anywhere, and includes the complete Guided Requirement Discovery logic in Phase 0.

**Status:** Recommended extensions to the original `task.md` v1.0 spec. These are **non-breaking, additive, and ratchet-only** – every change must strictly improve the sacred metrics (Critic ≥ 9.8/10, test pass, living-spec sync, invariant compliance, observability, self-optimization velocity).  

**Rethink Summary (10× audited, Python-constrained):**  
After 10 full passes cross-referencing the original `task.md` against the ultraworkers/claw-code clean-room reimplementation (and its parity mirror), the core insight remains: **Claw Code provides the strongest public patterns for a reliable agent harness**. Its composable tool registry, executable hook pipelines, plugin lifecycle, markdown-driven skills discovery, session compaction, self-documenting CLAW.md pattern, and layered orchestration are gold.  

Since the mandate is **Python-only**, we fully embrace the existing Python porting workspace in claw-code (`src/`) as the reference implementation layer. We do **not** pursue any Rust components, crates, or ports. Instead, we replicate and extend the Python-side architectural patterns (tool metadata in `tools.py`, command metadata in `commands.py`, models/dataclasses, query engine, manifest generation) directly into N1ch01as Architect. This keeps everything lightweight, rapidly iterable, and fully local via standard Python tooling (pip, no Docker).  

We preserve 100% of the original philosophy (OpenClaw soul, Karpathy ratchet, Hermes closed loop, Agent Lightning, Meta-Harness, Claude Code core skills: Superpowers, GSD, gstack). We amplify them by grafting Python-adapted Claw Code patterns for superior tool wiring, safety, observability, and extensibility.

## 1. Executive Recommendation  
**Adopt Python Claw Code harness patterns as the internal runtime substrate for N1ch01as Architect.**  
Use the clean-room Python porting approach (metadata-driven tools/commands, dataclasses for state, manifest/query engines) to make the Orchestrator, Coder, Skill Creator, Tracer, Trainer/Optimizer, and Meta-Harness Proposer dramatically more reliable and observable. All generated systems remain 100% Python backend (FastAPI) + React frontend, installed locally via `pip` and `npm`.

## 2. Specific, Actionable Upgrades (All Mandatory for v1.1, Python-Only)

### 2.1 Skills System – Python Claw Code Parity (Highest ROI)
Current `task.md` has `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` + `skills/` folder + pre-loaded Superpowers/GSD/gstack.  
**Upgrade to Python Claw Code skill model:**

- Implement **markdown-driven discovery** (mirroring claw-code commands/skills handling): skills auto-discovered from any `.md` file in `skills/` with consistent front-matter + executable sections (Python functions or prompt templates).
- Add **dynamic loading** via a Python `skill_loader.py` that parses markdown and registers skills at runtime (inspired by Python-side command/tool metadata in claw-code).
- Support **live reload** for skills during Hermes Closed Learning Loop (use Python's importlib.reload or file watchers for development velocity).
- Pre-load Superpowers, GSD, and gstack by converting them into proper Claw Code-style markdown skills with Python-callable sections. Store executable logic in `skills/` as `.py` modules referenced by markdown.

**New files in Phase 0.5:**
- `skills/skill_loader.py` – Core discovery and registration logic.
- Update `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md` to follow markdown skill format for consistency with Claw Code patterns.

**Impact:** Hermes Closed Learning Loop becomes far more powerful; newly created skills are immediately discoverable and usable without restarting the Orchestrator.

### 2.2 Tool Registry + Hook Pipeline (Safety & Observability Moat)
Adopt the Python mirroring approach from claw-code (`tools.py`, `commands.py`, `models.py`):

- **Tool Registry**: Create `tools/tool_registry.py` that dynamically registers all tools (Research Swarm specialists, Coder delegation, Tracer, etc.) using dataclasses (mirroring claw-code models). Tools defined via metadata for easy extension.
- **Executable Hook Pipeline**: Implement `hooks/tool_hooks.py` with pre/post hooks supporting mutation, deny, or rewrite (Python functions chained together). Every Task Brief, tool call, Critic score, and span goes through this pipeline.
  - Integrate Agent Lightning Tracer as a built-in hook (non-invasive).
  - Add enforcement hooks: `deny_docker`, `enforce_local_only`, `ratchet_gate`, `pre_dispatch_review_validator`, `skill_usage_compliance`.

**Benefits:** Mechanical enforcement of all invariants from `task.md` section 5 with zero boilerplate. Traces flow naturally into `LIGHTNING_STORE.md`.

### 2.3 Plugin System (Extensibility Without Forking)
Claw Code’s plugin model (adapted to Python):

- Create `plugins/` folder with `plugin_manifest.py` and a simple loader.
- Plugins can add new tools, hooks, Research Swarm specialists, or linter families.
- Meta-Harness Proposer can propose, evaluate, and dynamically load new plugins as part of outer-loop optimization (using Python import mechanics).

This turns N1ch01as into an extensible Python agent platform while keeping the core harness minimal and pure-Python.

### 2.4 Session & Memory Management – Python Claw Code Compaction
Enhance `MEMORY.md` + `USER_PROFILE.md` + `LIGHTNING_STORE.md`:

- Implement session compaction in `runtime/session_compactor.py` (Python-only, triggered at ~60% token budget to prevent GSD-style context rot).
- Use dataclasses (claw-code style) for structured state: compact summaries + on-demand raw spans.
- Thinking Clock idle cognition runs against the compacted session for proactive improvements without bloat.

### 2.5 Self-Documenting Harness – CLAW.md Pattern (Python Edition)
Upgrade `AGENTS.md`:

- Rename or alias to `CLAW.md` as the canonical self-referential guidance file (mirroring claw-code).
- `CLAW.md` includes verification steps the Orchestrator reads on every Startup Ritual: run Ruff linting, pytest on harness tests, Critic + Paranoid Reviewer gates, Meta-Harness check, etc.
- Embed working agreements and the full Startup Ritual so the Python Orchestrator can literally read and follow its own manual.

**New file:** `CLAW.md` (upgraded from AGENTS.md) with Python-specific verification commands.

### 2.6 AI-Orchestrated Development Workflow (Python-Native OmX Style)
Leverage the Python porting workspace philosophy:

- After major phases, Meta-Harness Proposer spawns parallel reviews using Research Swarm + gstack (Python function calls, no external Rust CLI).
- Trainer/Optimizer runs persistent verification loops in pure Python before ratchet decisions.

This keeps the entire meta-system self-contained in Python for maximum iteration speed.

## 3. Updated Phase 0.5 Additions (Exact Python-Only Files/Folders)
In Phase 0.5 (Harness Initialization), add the following alongside the original requirements:

- `CLAW.md` (upgraded self-documenting guidance with Python verification steps)
- `tools/tool_registry.py` + dataclasses for tools/commands (claw-code inspired)
- `hooks/tool_hooks.py` + default pipeline implementing all invariants
- `plugins/plugin_manifest.py` + loader
- `skills/skill_loader.py` + markdown discovery
- `runtime/session_compactor.py`
- `src/` style helpers if needed for manifest/query (e.g., `harness_manifest.py`, `query_engine.py` for internal audits)
- Update initial Git commit to include “+ Python Claw Code harness parity (tool registry, hooks, plugins, skills discovery, session compaction)”

All new code is pure Python 3.12+, using standard libraries + FastAPI-compatible dependencies already mandated.

## 4. New Invariants to Add to Section 5 (Quality Gates)
- Tool registry and hook pipeline executed on every action (logged via Tracer hook)
- Skills discovered and loaded exclusively via `skill_loader.py` (markdown + Python modules)
- Session compaction triggered automatically
- Plugin manifest validated on Orchestrator startup
- `CLAW.md` self-verification passes before any code generation or delegation
- All components use Python dataclasses for state (claw-code style) for legibility

## 5. Expected Outcomes After Python-Only Integration
- N1ch01as Architect becomes the **strongest Python-native meta-system** that ships with a full Claw Code-inspired harness.
- Self-optimization velocity increases significantly (Hermes + Agent Lightning + Meta-Harness ride on clean, metadata-driven Python patterns).
- Generated projects inherit the same Python harness patterns → users receive fully local, self-improving systems with superior tool wiring and observability.
- Development remains extremely fast: everything iterates with `pip install -e .` and standard Python tools.

## 6. Implementation Priority Order (Python-Only)
1. Skills System + `CLAW.md` + `skill_loader.py` (Phase 0.5)
2. Tool Registry + Hook Pipeline (`tools/` and `hooks/`)
3. Session Compaction
4. Plugin System
5. Integration of all hooks into Startup Ritual and Task Brief delegation

These recommendations are **ratchet-safe** and fully Python-only: every addition strictly improves observability, extensibility, safety, and self-improvement speed while preserving the original vision, local-first mandate (pip/npm only), FastAPI + React stack, and Claude Code core skills.

**End of task_extension_01.md**  
Apply these Python-only upgrades before declaring v1.1 of N1ch01as Architect. The resulting system will be a highly reliable, observable, and extensible Python agentic meta-builder.

# Build Central LLM API Usage & Cost Dashboard App

## Project Name Suggestion
**LLMUsageHub** or **MultiLLM Dashboard** or **API Cost Central** or **LLM Spend Tracker**

## 1. Project Overview
Create a **web application** that provides a **single central view** for tracking usage, costs, balances, spending, and token consumption across **all** of the user's LLM API accounts.

The user currently has accounts with:  
- x.ai (Grok API)  
- Poe  
- MiniMax  
- Kimi (Moonshot AI)  
- OpenRouter  
...and many others.

The app should let the user add their API keys once and see **everything aggregated in one beautiful dashboard** — total monthly spend, remaining credits, per-provider breakdowns, charts, trends, alerts, etc.

**Reference / Inspiration**:
Inspired by **[cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch)** (the popular desktop tool for managing LLM providers for Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI). This web app is **purely focused on usage/cost analytics** across direct personal API keys, serving as a usage-only companion to cc-switch but as a web application.

## 2. Core Goals
- One unified place to monitor **all** LLM spending and usage.
- Secure, local-only storage of API keys (never sent to any server).
- Automatic or on-demand fetching of usage/billing data.
- Historical tracking + visualizations.
- Extremely extensible — easy to add new providers.
- Beautiful, modern UI similar to cc-switch.

## 3. Key Features (Must-Have)

### Provider Management
- Add / edit / remove accounts with: name, provider type (preset), API key, base URL (for custom endpoints), notes.
- Pre-built **presets** for as many providers as possible (see section 4).
- Support multiple accounts per provider.
- One-click “Refresh All” and individual refresh buttons.

### Usage & Balance Fetching
- Prefer **official APIs** where available (e.g. `/usage`, `/billing`, `/balance`, `/v1/token_plan/remains`, etc.).
- Fallback options:
  - Manual entry of current usage/balance.
  - Web dashboard scraping (using Playwright if needed, last resort).
- Background auto-refresh (configurable interval) + manual refresh.
- Store full history snapshots in local DB.

### Dashboard UI
- **Overview page**:
  - Total estimated USD spend (today / this month / all time).
  - Total remaining credits/balance (normalized where possible).
  - Number of active providers + quick status.
- **Provider cards** (grid or list):
  - Name + logo (if available).
  - Current balance / remaining credits.
  - Spend this month + trend indicator.
  - Last updated timestamp.
- **Charts**:
  - Spending trend (line chart — daily/weekly).
  - Cost breakdown by provider (pie).
  - Token usage by model (bar).
  - Usage heatmap or calendar view.
- **Detailed tables**:
  - Per-provider usage history.
  - Model-level breakdown.
- **Alerts**:
  - Low balance warnings (configurable thresholds).
  - High daily spend notifications.

### Cost Calculation
- Built-in pricing tables for major models (input/output tokens → USD).
- Allow user to override pricing per model.
- Show estimated USD even when provider only reports tokens.

### Data Persistence & Export
- Local **SQLite** database for all historical usage snapshots.
- Export full data as CSV or JSON.

### Security & UX
- API keys stored **encrypted** locally (Fernet symmetric encryption).
- Dark/light theme (default dark, matching modern AI tools).
- Browser-based UI accessible from localhost.
- Fully offline-first after initial setup.
- Responsive, clean, professional UI.

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 2)
- AI-powered insights (“You spent 68% on Kimi this month — consider switching heavy tasks to Groq”).
- Import/export configuration (including possible cc-switch import).
- Per-model cost forecasting.
- Optional proxy/router mode (like LiteLLM or cc-switch) so the app can also log usage from actual API calls.

## 4. Supported Providers (List as Many as Possible)
The app must ship with **pre-built presets** (fetch logic + pricing) for **as many providers as possible**. Start with user-mentioned ones, then expand.

**High Priority (User’s Current Providers)**
- xAI (Grok API) — console.x.ai usage / billing endpoints
- Poe.com — usage/points_history and current_balance endpoints
- OpenRouter — account usage API
- MiniMax — token plan remains and usage endpoints
- Kimi (Moonshot AI) — platform.moonshot.ai usage/balance API

**Other Major Providers (Include Full Presets)**
- OpenAI
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google Gemini / Vertex AI
- Groq
- Mistral AI
- Together.ai
- Fireworks.ai
- DeepSeek
- SiliconFlow
- Zhipu AI (GLM / ChatGLM)
- Baichuan
- StepFun
- Alibaba (DashScope / Qwen)
- Baidu (ERNIE)
- Tencent (Hunyuan)
- iFlytek (Spark)
- 01.AI
- Cohere
- Perplexity
- Replicate
- Hugging Face Inference Endpoints
- Novita.ai
- Lepton AI
- Azure OpenAI
- AWS Bedrock (if possible via API or manual)
- Any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint (user can add base URL + key)

For providers without public usage APIs, still include presets with:
- Manual balance entry
- Notes on how to copy-paste from their dashboard

## 5. Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.1 (auto-generated from FastAPI, browsable at /docs)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **HTTP Client**: httpx (async)
- **Security**: API keys encrypted at rest using cryptography Fernet
- **Background Tasks**: FastAPI BackgroundTasks + APScheduler

### API Design (OpenAPI)
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- Interactive API docs via Swagger UI at /docs
- ReDoc alternative at /redoc

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **HTTP Client**: Axios or fetch API

### Architecture
- **Web App** (not desktop) — runs locally in browser
- Backend runs as a local server (localhost:8000)
- Frontend served by FastAPI static files or separate Vite dev server
- 100% local — no cloud sync unless explicitly added later

## 6. Development Phases (Suggested)
1. Project setup (FastAPI backend + React frontend + SQLite).
2. Provider management + secure key storage.
3. Core usage fetcher system (abstract interface).
4. Implement 5–6 high-priority providers (xAI, Poe, OpenRouter, MiniMax, Kimi, OpenAI).
5. Dashboard UI + charts.
6. Add remaining providers + pricing tables.
7. Background refresh, alerts, export, polish.
8. Testing + documentation.

## 7. Deliverables
- Complete source code with excellent comments and README.
- Clear instructions on **how to add a new provider** (new Python module + pricing config).
- Setup scripts for running locally with FastAPI + React.
- Sample data / test mode.
- License: MIT (or whatever user prefers).

This spec should give the coding agent everything needed to build a production-ready, beautiful, and highly useful central usage dashboard. Feel free to ask the user for clarification on specific provider APIs or preferred tech choices.

**Ready to code!** 🚀

**Build:**
- **Agent Factory** (`packages/agent-factory`): `AgentConfig (YAML) → runnable BaseAgent`. Validates prompt/rubric/tools/QC refs; registers into `agents/_registry.yaml`; generates the per-agent test skeleton. This is the engine for M7–M9.
- **Workflow A craft agents** (subset, via factory): TrendIntelligenceAgent, CopywriterAgent, SocialMediaStrategistAgent, PromptEngineerAgent/GeneratorOperator, AIQAConsistencyAgent, EditorAgent, AccessibilityOptimizerAgent, AudienceSimAgent, AnalystAgent — exactly the crew in [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §3.1.
- **Workflow A DAG** (`workflows/A_viral_hook.py`): Concept → Production → Post → Review → Distribution → Post-launch, with the spec'd critic gates.
- End-to-end run: brief → DIA → Planner builds the A-DAG → agents execute (mock gen) → artifacts flow with handoff contract → critique bus active → QC mesh gates → C2PA-signed deliverable → events on the bus.

**Steps:**
1. **Read (subagent).** `spec-reader` extracts the six fields above into a structured `AgentBrief`.
2. **Map self-quality → metrics.** Convert "Self-Quality Criteria" into concrete `MetricSpec`s with thresholds (e.g., DoP `rule_of_thirds>=τ, exposure_zone∈[III,VII], color_temp_var<=ΔK`; Colorist `deltaE<2`; SoundMixer `lufs==target, stoi>=0.85`). Many map to existing `packages/qc` validators or the Aesthetics Agent.
3. **Author the L2 rubric/constitution.** Turn "Surpass-Human Signal" + craft sources into a role constitution in `eval/rubrics/<agent>.yaml` (this is what LLM-as-judge scores against). Cite the craft authority named in the spec (Murch's Rule of Six for Editor, 12 principles for Animator, etc.).
4. **Define tools.** Allowlist only the providers/tools this agent may call (e.g., PromptEngineer → MediaGenProvider; Colorist → grade tool; FactChecker → RAG + WebResearch). Enforced by `agent-core`.
5. **Wire critique edges.** From the §4 critique matrix: `critiques_from` and `critiques_on`. ComplianceAgent edges are always blocking.
6. **Write the AgentConfig (YAML)** and register in `agents/_registry.yaml`.
7. **Author the versioned system prompt** (`agents/.../prompt.vN.md`) embedding role, constitution summary, self-refine instruction, and output schema (must emit a valid `Artifact`).
8. **TDD (subagent `test-author`):** golden-input fixtures → assert L1 schema pass, L2 rubric ≥85, correct critique emission/acceptance, tool-allowlist enforcement, metering present, provenance populated.
9. **Implement = instantiate.** `AgentFactory.build(config)` — no new code path; if you find yourself writing bespoke logic, that logic belongs in `agent-core` or a tool, not the agent.
10. **Review (subagent `code-reviewer`)** against DoD + §14 themes; fix; commit `feat(agent-<n>): <Name>`.
11. **Register in workflows** that use it; extend the relevant archetype integration test.
