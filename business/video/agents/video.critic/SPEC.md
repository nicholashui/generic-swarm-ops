## Responsibility

Simulates reviewer, press, or jury interpretation

## Knowledge distillation sources

Criticism corpora, festival-jury commentary, review archives

## Self-quality criteria

Interpretive depth, consistency, reviewer-mode diversity

## Surpass-human signal

Provides broader qualitative coverage than ad hoc internal taste review

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** DirectorAgent, AudienceSimAgent, FestivalStrategistAgent, JudgeAgent

- **Comments on:** Auteur read, tone mismatch, festival/press vulnerability

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Review corpora, jury rubrics, qualitative scoring tools

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Multi-agent debate as critic panel

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Comprehensive Functional Specification: Aesthetics Agent — Computational "Artiste Sense" Critic & Alignment Service for the VA-Agent-Swarm**

**Document Version:** 1.0 (Final – Complete & Exhaustive)
**Date:** May 29, 2026
**Authors:** Grok (xAI) + Collaborative Iteration with User Nicholas (nicholas_hui)
**Target Audience:** Senior AI Engineering / Coding Agents (for immediate implementation)
**Purpose:** This is the **definitive, production-grade specification** for building the **Aesthetics Agent** — a stateful, multimodal evaluation-and-alignment service that operationalizes a simulated **"artiste sense"** (artistic/aesthetic intuition) for the entire VA-Agent-Swarm. It is the deep rethink of [`aesthetics_agents.md`](./aesthetics_agents.md): where that document is a *survey of methods*, this is a *buildable agent contract*. It reframes "teach AI artistic sense" from a single image scorer into a **shared aesthetic nervous system** — a critic that every generative agent consults, a reward signal that every fine-tuning loop trusts, and a personalization engine that carries a director's, brand's, or artist's taste across the whole pipeline.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Aesthetics Agent** is the swarm's computational embodiment of "artiste sense." It does not *replace* human taste — it **amplifies, encodes, and propagates** it at superhuman speed across 114 agents.

It serves three distinct, composable functions:

1. **The Critic (Perceive).** A multimodal, multi-head evaluator that scores any visual artifact — single frame, image, or full video clip — against a decomposed aesthetic rubric (composition, color harmony, lighting, depth, emotional resonance, technical quality, style fidelity, novelty). This is the swarm's shared "eye."
2. **The Aligner (Refine).** A preference-and-reward service that turns the Critic's judgments into actionable feedback and training signal — driving self-refinement loops, preference optimization (DPO/RLHF/RLAIF), and prompt steering for `PromptEngineerAgent`, `CinematographerAgent`, `ColoristAgent`, and peers.
3. **The Taste-Keeper (Personalize).** A profile store that captures *whose* aesthetic governs a project — a director's lookbook, a brand's guidelines, an artist's portfolio, an audience cohort's preferences — and conditions all scoring and alignment on that profile.

**Why this is a "deep rethink" and not a wrapper:**

| The naive guide says... | The Aesthetics Agent does... |
|---|---|
| "Train an aesthetic scorer (e.g., NIMA, LAION)." | Treats a single scalar score as *insufficient and dangerous*. Decomposes aesthetics into auditable sub-attributes + a temporal track for video, with calibrated uncertainty. |
| "Use the critic as a reward to fine-tune the generator." | Wraps every reward use in **anti-reward-hacking** guardrails (reward variance monitoring, ensemble disagreement, OOD detection, KL anchoring). |
| "Personalize on one artist's ratings." | Makes taste a **first-class, versioned, consent-governed profile** that flows through the swarm's handoff contract and critique bus. |
| Operates on still images. | Is **video-native first**: temporal coherence, motion aesthetics, cut rhythm, and per-shot-vs-sequence scoring. |
| Aesthetic sense = beauty prediction. | Aesthetic sense = beauty **+ intent fidelity + emotional target + brand/style fit + novelty**, gated so high scores never come from generic "pretty slop." |

The result is a single agent that other agents *cannot do their job without*: it is referenced by `agents.md` entries #6, #10, #14, #15, #16, #39, #46, #49 and others as "aesthetic regressor / CLIP-based aesthetic scoring," and this document is its authoritative definition.

---

### 2. Background: From "Artiste Sense" to Computational Aesthetics

The source document [`aesthetics_agents.md`](./aesthetics_agents.md) defines **"artiste sense"** as the intuitive, perceptual, and expressive sensitivity artists develop — an "eye" for composition, color harmony, rhythm, proportion, light/shadow, depth, and emotional resonance; a structural (3D) way of seeing; a psychological drive to express; and a grounded, iterative creative practice.

Its central thesis, which this spec adopts wholesale:

> AI cannot possess *genuine* lived artistic sense (no consciousness, no emotion), but it can develop a **sophisticated simulated version** through (a) data-driven evaluators trained on human aesthetic judgments, (b) preference-alignment feedback loops, and (c) computational-creativity extensions. The strongest results come from **human–AI symbiosis**, not autonomous AI artists.

This specification accepts that framing as ground truth and answers the only question the survey left open: **what is the precise, implementable agent contract that delivers it inside a 114-agent video production system?**

---

### 3. The Deep Rethink — Five Reframings

The act of "deeply rethinking" the guide produced five architectural commitments. Each is a deliberate departure from the naive "train a scorer" recipe.

**3.1 Aesthetics is a vector, not a scalar.**
A single 1–10 score is unaccountable and trivially reward-hacked. The Critic emits a **decomposed AestheticVector** — independent heads for composition, color, light, depth, subject treatment, technical quality, emotional resonance, style fidelity, and novelty — each with a calibrated confidence. The scalar is a *gated aggregation*, never the source of truth.

**3.2 Aesthetics is temporal.**
This is a video swarm. A montage of individually beautiful frames can be aesthetically incoherent. The Critic scores both **per-frame** and **per-sequence**: motion smoothness, temporal color/exposure stability, cut rhythm vs. genre prior, and "does the clip read as one authored gesture."

**3.3 Aesthetics is whose.**
Following the LAION-Aesthetics audit critique that a "one-size-fits-all" beauty model encodes a narrow, unexamined taste ([arXiv:2601.09896](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.09896v1)), the agent refuses to pretend there is one universal beauty. Every score is conditioned on an explicit **AestheticProfile** (director / brand / artist / audience cohort / "neutral baseline"). Personalization is the default, not an add-on. Recent work shows LLM-interview-elicited personalized aesthetic models can exceed generic ones at predicting an individual's judgments ([arXiv:2605.14761](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.14761v1)).

**3.4 Aesthetics must not be hackable.**
The moment the Critic becomes a reward, generators learn to exploit it (high-frequency texture spam, saturation blowouts, "AI-glossy" sheen). The Aligner therefore ships with first-class **anti-reward-hacking** machinery — ensemble disagreement, reward-variance monitoring (large/diverse reward models retain high variance and resist collapse, per [arXiv:2509.08826](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.08826v1)), KL anchoring to a reference model, OOD artifact detectors, and inference-time mitigation ([arXiv:2510.01549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)). Rich, rationale-bearing preferences are favored over opaque scalars ([arXiv:2503.11720](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11720)).

**3.5 Aesthetics is gated by intent.**
Beauty divorced from the brief is noise. The aggregate quality is multiplied by **intent fidelity** (does it match the shot intent / prompt / brand?) and **emotional-target match** (does it land the intended valence/arousal?). A gorgeous image that ignores the director's intent scores low. This mirrors the value-gated selection in the [General Creative Agent](./general_creative_agent_functional_specification.md) (SSOR).

---

### 4. Formal Aesthetic Model

Let an artifact \( x \) (image or video clip) be evaluated under an aesthetic profile \( p \), an intent/brief \( b \), and an emotional target \( e \).

The Critic produces a **decomposed aesthetic vector**:

\[
\mathbf{A}(x \mid p) = \bigl[\, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \,\bigr], \quad a_i \in [0,1], \; \text{with confidence } \sigma_i
\]

over \( k \) sub-attributes (the **Aesthetic Dimensions**, §6). The **gated aesthetic quality** is:

\[
\operatorname{AQ}(x \mid p,b,e) \;=\; \underbrace{G\!\left(\mathbf{A}(x\mid p), \mathbf{w}_p\right)}_{\text{profiled aggregate}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{I(x,b)}_{\text{intent fidelity}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{E(x,e)}_{\text{emotion match}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{\big(1 - H(x)\big)}_{\text{anti-hack penalty}}
\]

Where:
- \( G(\cdot, \mathbf{w}_p) \): profile-weighted aggregation of the attribute vector (weights \( \mathbf{w}_p \) come from the active `AestheticProfile`; a brand may weight color/brand-fit heavily, a horror DoP may weight light/contrast).
- \( I(x,b) \in [0,1] \): intent fidelity (e.g., CLIP-T / VLM grounding of artifact against shot-intent text or reference; target ≥ 0.32 per `DirectorAgent` rubric in `agents.md`).
- \( E(x,e) \in [0,1] \): emotional-target match (valence/arousal regression vs. target, shared with `ComposerAgent` emotional-arc validator).
- \( H(x) \in [0,1] \): hack/artifact likelihood (OOD score, ensemble disagreement, artifact detector) — high \( H \) collapses the score regardless of surface prettiness.

For video, AQ is computed per-frame **and** at sequence level, then combined:

\[
\operatorname{AQ}_{\text{clip}} = \alpha \cdot \operatorname{mean}_t \operatorname{AQ}(x_t) \;+\; \beta \cdot \operatorname{AQ}_{\text{temporal}}(x_{1:T}) \;-\; \gamma \cdot \operatorname{Var}_t\!\big[\text{exposure, color, identity}\big]
\]

penalizing temporal instability (flicker, color drift, identity break — overlaps with `AIQAConsistencyAgent` #49).

**Hard principles (encoded in code):**
- **No naked scalar.** Any consumer requesting only `AQ` also receives \( \mathbf{A} \), \( H \), and the top failing dimension.
- **Uncertainty travels.** Every score ships with confidence; low-confidence scores must escalate to HiTL or a second model, never silently pass.
- **Profile-or-refuse.** If no profile is supplied, the agent uses an explicitly labeled `neutral_baseline_v{n}` profile and flags that the result is taste-agnostic.

---

### 5. Architecture

The Aesthetics Agent is a three-subsystem service sharing one profile store and one model registry.

**5.1 The Critic (Perceive).** Ensemble of complementary backbones:
- A fast **regression head** on a vision backbone (SigLIP / CLIP-ViT) — Aesthetic-Predictor-V2.5-style MLP for cheap first-pass screening at scale.
- A **VLM critic** (Grok-4.x vision, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o-vision) producing fine-grained, attribute-level natural-language critique + scores — the "explainable eye."
- Specialized detectors: artifact/hand/face-distortion detectors, ΔE color drift, exposure histogram/zone analysis, rule-of-thirds & leading-lines geometry, FID/FVD against style reference, temporal smoothness (optical flow), VBench-style video metrics.

**5.2 The Aligner (Refine).** Converts verdicts into action:
- **Self-refine feedback**: a prioritized, machine-readable critique ("scene 3 underexposed in zone IV; subject collides with right edge; color drifts +6 ΔE across cut").
- **Reward signal**: scalar/vector reward for RLHF / RLAIF / DPO / ReFL-style diffusion fine-tuning, always emitted with variance + ensemble-agreement metadata.
- **Preference pairs**: for DPO-style training, with rationale (rich preferences) not just A≻B.
- **Prompt-steer hints**: concrete prompt deltas handed to `PromptEngineerAgent` (#46) to reach target in ≤3 iterations.

**5.3 The Taste-Keeper (Personalize).** Versioned, consent-governed `AestheticProfile` store (see §10), elicited via portfolio ingestion, pairwise preference collection, and LLM-interview elicitation ([arXiv:2605.14761](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.14761v1)).

**5.4 Anti-Hack Guardrails.** Cross-cutting safety layer wrapping every reward emission (see §11).

### 6. Aesthetic Dimensions (the Decomposed Rubric)

The Critic emits a score + confidence for each dimension. Profiles re-weight them; they are *never* collapsed before being logged.

| # | Dimension | What it measures | Primary signal |
|---|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| D1 | **Composition** | Balance, rule-of-thirds, leading lines, negative space, framing, staging clarity | Geometry detector + VLM |
| D2 | **Color Harmony** | Palette coherence, contrast, temperature consistency, mood vector | Color histogram, ΔE, palette extraction |
| D3 | **Light & Shadow** | Exposure zones, key/fill ratio, direction, dynamic range, mood | Histogram/zone analysis, VLM |
| D4 | **Depth & Form** | 3D readability, layering, focal depth, structural "seeing" (per artiste-sense) | Depth estimation + VLM |
| D5 | **Subject Treatment** | Subject prominence, gaze, gesture, silhouette readability | Saliency + pose/landmark |
| D6 | **Technical Quality** | Sharpness, noise, banding, artifacts, resolution adequacy | Detectors + IQA model |
| D7 | **Emotional Resonance** | Evoked valence/arousal vs. target | Affect regressor (shared w/ ComposerAgent) |
| D8 | **Style Fidelity** | Adherence to style bible / lookbook / brand | CLIP/embedding distance to reference set |
| D9 | **Novelty / Distinctiveness** | Originality vs. "generic AI slop"; inverted-U (not maximal) | Embedding rarity vs. corpus |
| D10 | **Temporal Aesthetics** *(video)* | Motion smoothness, cut rhythm, temporal stability, "one authored gesture" | Optical flow, VBench-style, beat-sync |

**Novelty note (D9):** Following the SSOR inverted-U principle from the GCA spec, novelty is rewarded in a *moderate* band — too low = cliché/derivative; too high = incoherent. This is what prevents the agent from rewarding bland, statistically-average "pretty" output.

### 7. Functional Requirements

**7.1 Input (JSON).**
```json

  "budget": { "max_latency_ms": 800, "tier": "fast | deep" }
}
```

**7.2 Output — `AestheticVerdict` (JSON + Markdown).**
```json
{
  "artifact_ref": "asset_id_v2",
  "profile_id": "director_lynchian_v3",
  "aesthetic_vector": { "composition": 0.81, "color_harmony": 0.74, "light": 0.62,
                        "depth": 0.70, "subject": 0.88, "technical": 0.91,
                        "emotion": 0.66, "style_fidelity": 0.79, "novelty": 0.55,
                        "temporal": 0.83 },
  "confidence": { "composition": 0.9, "light": 0.6, "...": "..." },
  "intent_fidelity": 0.79,
  "emotion_match": 0.71,
  "hack_likelihood": 0.04,
  "aesthetic_quality": 0.73,
  "top_failing_dimensions": ["light", "novelty"],
  "actionable_critique": [
    "Underexposed in zone IV; lift key +1/3 stop on subject left.",
    "Palette is conventional for genre; consider one strategic outlier hue."
  ],
  "prompt_steer_hints": ["add 'low-key chiaroscuro, single practical source'"],
  "uncertainty_flag": false,
  "escalate_to_hitl": false,
  "provenance": { "models": ["aesV2.5","grok-vision-4.x"], "ensemble_agreement": 0.86 }
}
```

**7.3 Modes.**
- `screen` — fast scalar gate for high-volume candidate culling (regression head only).
- `score` — full decomposed vector + verdict.
- `align` — emit reward/preference signal for a training/refinement loop.
- `compare` — pairwise/listwise ranking of N candidates (for "choose the best take").
- `refine` — generate → score → critique → suggest, iterated (mimics the artist's iterative loop).

**7.4 Statefulness.** Per-project memory of accepted/rejected artifacts ratchets the profile and feeds Reflexion-style episodic memory (consistent with swarm principle "Continuous Self-Improvement").

**7.5 Non-functional.** Fast-tier screening ≤ 800 ms/artifact; deep-tier ≤ 8 s; horizontal GPU autoscale; deterministic given fixed profile + model versions (reproducibility for audits).

---

### 8. Integration with the VA-Agent-Swarm

This agent is **cross-cutting infrastructure**, registered alongside the Research Agent, GCA, and Optimization Agent in [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) §4.

**8.1 Consumers (who calls it and why).**

| Agent (from `agents.md`) | Use of Aesthetics Agent |
|---|---|
| #6 CinematographerAgent (DoP) | Replaces ad-hoc "CLIP-based aesthetic scoring" — composition/light/color self-refine rubric |
| #10 ColoristAgent | ΔE drift, mood-vector match, palette coherence scoring |
| #14 StoryboardAgent / #15 ConceptArtistAgent / #16 ProductionDesignAgent | Style-bible adherence + composition scoring |
| #39 FoodStylistAgent / #40 TravelCineAgent / #45 RealEstatePhotoAgent | The shared "aesthetic regressor" these specs reference |
| #46 PromptEngineerAgent | `refine` mode + `prompt_steer_hints` to hit target in ≤3 iterations |
| #49 AIQAConsistencyAgent | Temporal stability / artifact (`hack_likelihood`) cross-check |
| #1 DirectorAgent / #56 JudgeAgent | Tie-break and blind-preference adjudication on candidate takes |
| Delivery & Marketing (#27, #28, #31) | Thumbnail/hook aesthetic scoring for predicted engagement |

**8.2 Critique Bus.** Verdicts are published on the swarm's structured critique bus (`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` §7.1) with `critique_type: "aesthetic_feedback"`, `severity`, `rubric_score`, and `artifact_ref`, so any agent can react asynchronously.

**8.3 Handoff Contract.** The `AestheticVerdict` is attached to the artifact's `qc_status` field in the **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** (`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` §7), making aesthetic state travel with provenance through every phase.

**8.4 Relationship to neighbors.**
- **vs. GCA (creativity):** GCA *generates* novel-yet-useful candidates; Aesthetics Agent *judges and refines* them. GCA's novelty score (D9) is supplied by this agent. They form a generate↔evaluate loop.
- **vs. AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49):** AIQA catches *errors* (drift, broken hands, identity breaks); Aesthetics Agent judges *taste*. `hack_likelihood` is the shared boundary — co-trained, deduplicated.
- **vs. Psychological Recommendation / AudienceSim:** those predict *audience* preference; Aesthetics Agent encodes *authorial/brand* taste. A profile can be an audience-cohort profile, bridging the two.

---

### 9. The Three Operating Loops

**9.1 Critic Loop (evaluate).** `artifact → ensemble score → decompose → gate by intent/emotion → anti-hack check → AestheticVerdict`.

**9.2 Alignment Loop (teach the generator).** Mirrors the source guide's pipeline, hardened:
1. Generate N candidates (base model).
2. `compare` mode ranks them; `score` mode decomposes.
3. Human raters spot-check a sampled subset (symbiosis, not full autonomy).
4. Build **rich preference pairs** (with rationale) → DPO / RLHF / RLAIF / ReFL update.
5. Monitor reward variance & ensemble agreement; if variance collapses → suspect hacking, freeze, escalate.
6. Repeat; generator internalizes the taste and "instinctively" picks stronger outputs.

**9.3 Personalization Loop (capture whose taste).**
1. Ingest portfolio / lookbook / brand guide → seed embedding profile.
2. Collect pairwise preferences and/or run **LLM-interview elicitation** to surface latent criteria.
3. Fit profile weights \( \mathbf{w}_p \); validate against held-out judgments.
4. Version, sign, and store; expose `profile_id` to the swarm.

---

### 10. Personalization: the `AestheticProfile`

A first-class, versioned, consent-governed object.

```json
{
  "profile_id": "director_lynchian_v3",
  "owner": "consenting_entity_id",
  "consent": { "scope": "project_x", "expires": "2027-01-01", "c2pa_signed": true },
  "weights": { "light": 0.22, "color_harmony": 0.18, "novelty": 0.15, "...": "..." },
  "exemplars": ["asset_uri_1", "..."],
  "anti_exemplars": ["asset_uri_9", "..."],
  "elicited_criteria": ["prefers low-key contrast", "avoids saturated reds", "..."],
  "embedding_centroid": "vec://...",
  "version": 3,
  "lineage": ["v1","v2","v3"]
}
```

Profile types: **Director**, **Brand**, **Artist**, **Audience-Cohort** (links to [Psychological Recommendation](./psychological_recommendation_agent_functional_specification.md)), **Genre-prior**, **Neutral-baseline**. Profiles are composable (e.g., `brand_acme ⊕ genre_noir`) with documented precedence.

**Governance:** Personalizing on a named human's taste/portfolio requires consent recorded in the profile and cleared by `ComplianceAgent` (#37) — same rigor as voice/likeness cloning.

---

### 11. Reward Hacking, Failure Modes & Defenses

The single greatest risk: when the Critic becomes a reward, generators learn to *fool the eye*, not *please it*.

| Failure mode | Symptom | Defense |
|---|---|---|
| **Texture/detail spam** | High score, busy high-frequency noise | Artifact detector; frequency-domain sanity check; human spot-check |
| **Saturation/contrast blowout** | "AI-glossy" oversaturated look | ΔE & gamut bounds; per-dimension caps; brand profile constraints |
| **Mode collapse** | All outputs converge to one "safe" look | Reward-variance monitoring; large/diverse reward ensembles retain variance ([arXiv:2509.08826](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.08826v1)) |
| **Off-distribution exploitation** | Score high on inputs unlike training data | OOD detector → force `escalate_to_hitl`, never auto-pass |
| **Intent drift** | Beautiful but ignores brief | Intent-fidelity gate \( I(x,b) \) multiplies AQ |
| **Opaque-scalar overfit** | Generator games one number | Rich, rationale-bearing preferences ([arXiv:2503.11720](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11720)); decomposed vector never collapsed |
| **Taste monoculture / bias** | One narrow aesthetic encoded as "universal" | Mandatory explicit profiles; bias audit per LAION critique ([arXiv:2601.09896](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.09896v1)) |

**Core mechanisms:** (1) **Ensemble disagreement** — regression head, VLM critic, and detectors must agree; high disagreement raises \( H(x) \) and triggers HiTL. (2) **KL anchoring** to a reference generator during alignment to prevent runaway exploitation. (3) **Inference-time mitigation** for alignment without full fine-tuning ([arXiv:2510.01549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)). (4) **Held-out human eval** as the non-negotiable ground truth — the agent's correlation with human raters is itself continuously monitored and is a release gate.

---

### 12. Technical Architecture & Implementation Guidelines

- **Core classes:** `AestheticCritic`, `AttributeHead[]`, `EnsembleScorer`, `IntentGate`, `EmotionGate`, `AntiHackGuard`, `Aligner`, `PreferenceBuilder`, `TasteKeeper`, `AestheticProfile`, `AestheticsAgent` (facade).
- **Models:** SigLIP/CLIP-ViT backbone + MLP regression head (fast tier, Aesthetic-Predictor-V2.5 lineage); VLM critic via swarm LLM providers (Grok-4.x vision / Gemini 2.5 Pro / GPT-4o); detector zoo (artifact, ΔE, depth, flow, FID/FVD, VBench-style).
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch + `diffusers` (for ReFL/DPO hooks); LangGraph node for orchestration; FastAPI service; Redis Streams for critique-bus publication.
- **Stores:** vector DB (Chroma/Pinecone) for exemplars & embeddings; profile DB (versioned, signed); episodic memory for refine-loop learning.
- **Provenance:** every verdict logs model versions, ensemble agreement, profile version → C2PA-aligned audit trail.
- **Deliverables:** repo skeleton, `AestheticVerdict` schema, profile schema, example notebooks (image scoring, video scoring, DPO alignment loop, profile elicitation), integration adapters for #6/#10/#46/#49.

### 14. Limitations & Future Directions

- **No genuine lived aesthetic.** The agent's "sense" is statistical and derivative; it has no spontaneity or personal impulse. It is an *amplifier* of human taste — best used in symbiosis, with HiTL on novel or low-confidence judgments.
- **Taste is contested.** Even with explicit profiles, the corpus and rater pool carry bias; the agent surfaces *whose* taste it encodes rather than claiming universality.
- **Reward hacking is an arms race.** Defenses reduce, not eliminate, exploitation; held-out human eval remains the ground truth and release gate.
- **Future:** larger multimodal critics; brain-activity / biosignal proxies for emotional resonance; embodied/3D structural "seeing"; tighter artist co-training loops; cross-modal aesthetics (image↔music↔motion) shared with `ComposerAgent` and `ChoreographyAgent`.

**This specification is complete, self-contained, and ready for immediate coding.** It transforms the "artiste sense" survey into a buildable, swarm-integrated agent: a decomposed multimodal Critic, a hack-resistant Aligner, and a consent-governed Taste-Keeper — the shared aesthetic nervous system of the VA-Agent-Swarm.

Implement exactly as written. The resulting Aesthetics Agent will give all 114 agents a single, trustworthy, personalizable "eye."

### From `corpus/study/agent_loop_v3.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/agent_loop_v3.md`.


**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliability. |
| **Premortem Analysis** (2 / 10) | Phase 0 (after plan gen, before state commit) | Mandatory "assume spectacular failure in 6-12 months → work backward to identify top causes/risks → explicitly mitigate in living spec, success criteria, todo items, or agent roles." Can be run by orchestrator LLM or dedicated Red Team critic. | Directly strengthens Phase 0 planning with proactive risk simulation & critic; near-zero cost. |
| **After-Action Review (AAR)** (3 / 10) | Phase 4 (every milestone reflection or termination) | Structured 4-question template: (1) What was supposed to happen? (vs original spec/plan) (2) What actually happened? (from tracer/obs) (3) Why? (diagnosis) (4) What next? (lessons → concrete evolution actions). Feeds self-evolution. | Perfect upgrade for Phase 4 reflection + self-evolution; highly practical structured learning. |
| **Double-Loop Learning** (4 / 9.5) | Phase 4 (after AAR single-loop fixes) | After tactical fixes, explicitly ask: "What governing variables/assumptions (prompt templates, success criteria definitions, agent role boundaries, memory schemas, verification thresholds, or even the task decomposition strategy) led us here? Should they change at the meta level?" Only then commit versioned updates. | Core to making self-evolution truly powerful (double-loop) rather than symptom patching. |
| **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)** (5 / 9.5) + **Dual Process Theory (System 1 & 2)** (8 / 9) | Phase 1 (Thought/Decide step) + Memory layer | **Fast Recognition Path** (new): Before verbose ReAct, query Pattern Store (long-term memory of successful high-quality traces + outcome metadata + embeddings). If strong similarity match (and Cynefin context permits), perform lightweight mental simulation ("Similar to trace #47, expected good result with action Z") then act with minimal tokens. System 1 = fast/intuitive/RPD for routine/expert; System 2 = slow/deliberate full ReAct for novel/risky/uncertain. Metacognition (below) decides switch. Fallback to full loop on low confidence. | Enables high-value "Fast Recognition Path" in v3 for expert domains/repeated tasks; foundation for adaptive fast/slow thinking. |
| **Metacognition Cycle** (7 / 9) | Parallel lightweight process alongside all Phase 1 iterations | Ongoing: Planning (align intent to spec) → Monitoring (bias detection, context fit via Cynefin, progress vs todo/success criteria, confidence drift) → Evaluating (quick rigor pulse) → Adjust (trigger mode switch, early replan, or gate escalation in real time or at next decision). | Direct parallel to state management; easy to implement as lightweight meta-prompt or separate small LLM call. |
| **5 Whys + Ishikawa Fishbone + Fault Tree** (6 / 9) | Phase 4 (AAR "Why?" diagnosis) + Verifier/Critic issue analysis | On persistent failures or low-confidence observations: Drill with iterative 5 Whys; categorize root causes via Fishbone (People/Prompts, Process/Methods, Models/Tools, Data/Material, Environment/Context, Metrics) or simple fault tree. Results drive Double-Loop changes and spec hardening. | Greatly strengthens Thought + Reflection for complex problems; systematic visual + deep cause analysis. |
| **Red Team Thinking** (12 / 8) | Verifier / Phase 3 quality gates + Premortem | Dedicated critic mode or separate lightweight agent: "Adversarially attack this plan/draft/output to surface hidden weaknesses, edge cases, or single points of failure." Complements standard verifier schema. | Strong built-in devil’s advocate; easy to implement as dedicated critic agent role. |
| **Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework** (9 / 8.5) | Verifier prompt + Thought step augmentation | Enhance `verify_output` and decision prompts with Elements of Thought (purpose, question at issue, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, implications, point of view) + Intellectual Standards checklist (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness, sufficiency). | Excellent for enhancing Thought and Verifier quality; strong bias and rigor detection. |
| **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** (10 / 8.5) + **TRIZ** (14 / 8) | Phase 3 (Harmonize/Consolidation) + conflict resolution in self-evolution | When sub-results conflict or goals contradict: Use TOC Evaporating Cloud to surface and resolve core conflicts; apply TRIZ contradiction principles for inventive solutions. Feeds versioned prompt/agent edits. | Powerful for resolving conflicting goals; synergizes extremely well with TRIZ and self-evolution. |
| **Six Thinking Hats** (13 / 8) + **SCAMPER / Osborn-Parnes CPS** (15/11) | Phase 3 consolidation or creative sub-agent ideation | Optional multi-perspective pass (White=facts/data, Red=intuition/feelings, Black=risks/critic, Yellow=benefits/opportunities, Green=creativity/alternatives, Blue=process/meta) or SCAMPER checklist (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) during synthesis or when sub-agent is creative-writing/design-oriented. | Reduces blind spots effectively; directly upgrades ideation and creative sub-agents. |

**Additional Implementation Details (v3)**:
- **Memory Architecture Upgrade**: Add "Pattern Store" (vector + metadata of successful/failed traces with outcome scores) to support RPD fast matching. Hierarchical memory now explicitly tags traces with Cynefin context type for better retrieval.
- **Verifier / Critic Enhancements**: `verify_output` function now accepts `critic_mode` (or runs ensemble): "standard" | "red_team" | "paul_elder" | "six_hats". Returns aggregated issues + suggestions. Can be parallelized for depth.
- **Configurability in Task Spec**: New fields e.g. `"cognitive_profile": {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "complex"}` or auto-detected.
- **Metacognition Implementation**: Lightweight parallel prompt or small dedicated LLM call every N steps or on confidence drop / context shift. Updates shared state flags (e.g., `current_mode: "fast" | "full"`, `bias_flags: [...]`).
- **Early Exit / Efficiency**: Cynefin + RPD + Metacognition together allow safe early termination or fast-pathing on well-understood sub-problems without sacrificing the rigorous gates on hard parts — directly mitigating token waste and infinite-loop risks.

### Major Problem Categories & Frequency/Significance
1. **Specification & Design Ambiguities (Largest Category)**
   - Disobeying or misinterpreting task spec, vague roles, missing success criteria or output contracts.
   - **Impact**: Agents go off-track early; errors compound downstream.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 0: Mandatory structured Task Specification with explicit success criteria, constraints, output schema, and quality thresholds. Use "living spec" that can be updated.
     - Add automated spec validation (critic or schema check) before loop starts.
     - Clear role definitions and information contracts between orchestrator and sub-agents.

4. **Hallucinations, Error Compounding & Verification Weakness**
   - Fabricated facts, incorrect tool results interpretation, or unverified claims propagating (worse in multi-agent).
   - **Impact**: Unreliable final outputs; cascading failures.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - **Verifier / Critic agents** as mandatory quality gates (Phase 3 consolidation and after sub-results).
     - Structured observation schema (status, confidence, issues list) + cross-validation (compare across agents/sources).
     - Multi-form verification (factual grounding in observations + external checks).
     - Trajectory ranking (e.g., Prospector-style critic selects best among multiple attempts).
     - In self-evolution: Only commit changes validated on held-out traces.

### How Mitigations Integrate into the Loop Phases
- **Phase 0 (Init)**: Spec engineering + validation is the single highest-ROI fix.
- **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**: Cycle detection, bounded steps/reflection, structured observations, progress tracking.
- **Phase 2 (Delegation)**: Narrow sub-specs + contracts; orchestrator monitoring.
- **Phase 3 (Consolidation)**: Verifier/critic gates, cross-validation, harmonization.
- **Phase 4 (Reflection/Self-evolution)**: Validation before applying changes; bounded loops.
- **Phase 5 (Termination)**: Verifier + explicit Done with evidence.

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. **v3 Cognitive Enhancements (Cynefin + Premortem)**:
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): LLM or lightweight classifier tags the task (Simple / Complicated / Complex / Chaotic) based on clarity of cause-effect, expert knowledge needed, emergence, or crisis nature. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop behavior (see 1.4 table): e.g., Simple/Complicated → prefer Fast Recognition

**Version:** 2026-06-07 (Updated with comprehensive research on known agent loop failure modes from MASFT taxonomy & related studies, plus targeted mitigations from Reflexion, critic frameworks, structured specs, memory architectures, and production patterns)

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid.

### Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish.
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "issues": ["list of problems"],
       "next_suggestions": ["..."],
       "trace_id": "..."
     }
     ```
   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

step = 0
    while step < state.max_steps:
        step += 1
        current_hash = hash_state(state)
        if current_hash in state.seen_states:
            print("Cycle detected — forcing replan or terminate")
            # In production: trigger critic or escalate to human
            break
        state.seen_states.add(current_hash)

**Code Example: Lightweight Verifier / Critic Agent (Prompt + Schema)**

### Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

### Phase 4: Reflection, Critique & Self-Evolution (Advanced)
- **Per-trajectory or milestone reflection**: LLM summarizes trace, diagnoses failures/successes, proposes improvements (prompt edits, tool patches, new sub-agent types).
- **Self-evolution loop** (inspired by AgentOrchestra):
  1. Collect trace via tracer.
  2. Attribute errors / opportunities (LLM or TextGrad-style).
  3. Propose targeted changes (to prompts, tools, agent configs, or even generated code).
  4. Validate changes (re-execute on held-out or similar task; check metrics).
  5. If improved: Register new version (with lineage). Support rollback.
- **Critic Agent Role**: Separate lightweight agent that reviews drafts/plans without full execution. Can be invoked at gates.
- **Benefits**: Continuous improvement during runtime; production systems become more robust over repeated use on similar task distributions.

| Task Complexity       | Recommended Pattern                  | Key Features to Enable          | Example Use Case |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Simple fact lookup    | Flat ReAct (single loop)            | Tool calling, basic thought    | Quick search + answer |
| Multi-step research   | xAI Multi-Agent or Hierarchical     | Parallel agents, leader synth  | Deep analysis with sources |
| Coding / long project | Plan-first + Hierarchical + Worktrees | Sub-agents in isolation, todo.md | Full app generation + debug |
| Open-ended / creative | ReAct + Reflection + Self-evolution | Critic gates, versioned prompts| Iterative design refinement |
| High-stakes / reliable| All above + strong Quality Gates    | Structured results, validation | Enterprise automation |

- **Context explosion**: Aggressive summarization + hierarchical state (local sub-memories).
- **Infinite loops / thrashing**: Hard max iterations + progress tracking in todo + critic that can force replan or escalate.
- **Poor consolidation**: Mandate structured sub-results + dedicated harmonization/reporter step.
- **Hallucinations in plans**: Ground every major claim in observations; use critic before committing to plan.
- **Brittle delegation**: Use explicit sub-task specs + success criteria; validate returned results.
- **Lack of visibility**: Full tracing + optional streaming of reasoning.

This document is designed to be **executable guidance** — copy patterns, adapt pseudocode, and iterate. For refinements, specific code examples in Python/Node, or integration with your existing harness (e.g., critic loops, spec-driven task.md), provide more details on your current stack.

**Build (each as a crosscutting service agent, all on `BaseAgent`):**
1. **DIA (Deep Intent Analysis)** — parses briefs → structured intent (goals, audience, hidden agendas, constraints). The entry point of every production.
2. **GCA (SSOR)** — creative ideation engine; the 7-phase SSOR pipeline + domain factory. Consumed by Director/Screenwriter/ConceptArtist/Ideation.
3. **Process Optimization Agent** — DMAIC + Lean + multi-agent consensus over workflow telemetry.
4. **Strategic Goal Achievement** — 6-stage goal-clarification framework used by all planning agents.
5. **Complex Problem Solving** — WHAT/WHY/HOW/DO/REVIEW methodology for diagnostic agents.
6. **Aesthetics Agent** — the decomposed multimodal Critic + Aligner + Taste-Keeper (per the spec you authored); supplies `qc.l2`/perceptual scoring, novelty (D9) to GCA, and `aesthetic` critiques. Wire its `AestheticVerdict` into `packages/qc` and the critique bus.

**Build:**
- **Agent Factory** (`packages/agent-factory`): `AgentConfig (YAML) → runnable BaseAgent`. Validates prompt/rubric/tools/QC refs; registers into `agents/_registry.yaml`; generates the per-agent test skeleton. This is the engine for M7–M9.
- **Workflow A craft agents** (subset, via factory): TrendIntelligenceAgent, CopywriterAgent, SocialMediaStrategistAgent, PromptEngineerAgent/GeneratorOperator, AIQAConsistencyAgent, EditorAgent, AccessibilityOptimizerAgent, AudienceSimAgent, AnalystAgent — exactly the crew in [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §3.1.
- **Workflow A DAG** (`workflows/A_viral_hook.py`): Concept → Production → Post → Review → Distribution → Post-launch, with the spec'd critic gates.
- End-to-end run: brief → DIA → Planner builds the A-DAG → agents execute (mock gen) → artifacts flow with handoff contract → critique bus active → QC mesh gates → C2PA-signed deliverable → events on the bus.

**Claude Code workflow:** Build gateway first (typed, tested) so the UI has a real contract. Then UI components, driven by the WebSocket event types. Use Playwright for the critical journeys. Honor `RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` as a UI hardening backlog.

Each of the 10 archetypes (A–J) in [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §3 becomes one LangGraph graph in `workflows/`. They share the §3.0 skeleton (Greenlight → Pre-production → Production → Post → Review/Release → Distribution → Post-launch) and differ only in which agents lead each phase and which critics gate the handoff.

**Build order of workflows:** A (M6) → C, E, B (M7) → F, G, H, I (M8) → D (M11, needs personalization) → J (M12, full-system dry-run). A workflow is "done" when its DAG runs end-to-end on mock providers, every phase gate enforces its critic set, and the final artifact carries a complete provenance chain.

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (where in plan) |
|---|------|-----------|--------|----------------------------|
| R1 | Architecture flaw discovered after broad agent build | Med | High | Vertical slice M6 before breadth (G2, §6.1) |
| R2 | Contract drift across 114 agents | High | High | Frozen contracts + `contract-guardian` + snapshot tests (§5, §9.2) |
| R3 | Runaway LLM/gen cost | High | High | Metering+budget gates from M3; mock providers in CI; live-smoke cap (§10.2) |
| R4 | Temporal↔LangGraph boundary confusion | Med | High | ADR-003 + kill/resume tests in M2 (§6 M2) |
| R5 | LLM-judge score noise destabilizes gates | High | Med | Frozen, pinned judges + golden sets (§9.4) |
| R6 | Reward hacking / "pretty slop" from aesthetic reward | Med | Med | Aesthetics Agent anti-hack layer; ensemble disagreement; HiTL on low confidence |

| R13 | Scope creep (role inflation: new agents that close no real gap) | Med | Med | Reject per workflow-doc rule §1.1 working-rule #4; ADR required for any agent beyond the 114 |

### Theme 6 — Safety, Security & Compliance (51–60)
51. SafetyRedTeam attack-success ≤1% across the attack taxonomy.
52. Prompt-injection defenses on every agent ingesting external/user content.
53. Consent chain verified before any likeness/voice generation.
54. C2PA signs 100% of releasable artifacts; verification passes downstream.
55. FTC/HIPAA/GDPR-CCPA/IP/EU-AI-Act checklists wired into ComplianceAgent.
56. Secrets never in repo/logs; secret-scan hook + CI gate active.
57. RBAC enforced on all gateway mutations (gate approve, retry, config).
58. Dependency CVE scan + SBOM produced each release; criticals block.
59. AI-disclosure applied where required (avatar/synthetic content).
60. PII handled with generic placeholders in samples; real PII only in consented project data.

### Theme 8 — Frontend & Human Experience (71–80)
71. UI launches/monitors/critiques/approves/delivers Workflow A end-to-end.
72. WebSocket live updates are <50ms-class; DAG node states accurate.
73. No agent→UI direct calls (all via event bus + gateway).
74. WebSocket reconnect restores full state without duplication.
75. Gate Approval Dialog signs C2PA on approval; rejection routes feedback correctly.
76. Budget/quality dashboards reflect backend truth in real time.
77. Playwright E2E covers the critical journeys; green in CI.
78. RBAC denies unauthorized actions in the UI and gateway.
79. `RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` items triaged; criticals addressed.
80. Production-scale discovery adapts the DAG to project complexity (S-tiers).

### 15.2 Critical path
`M0 → M2 → M3 → M5 → M6 → M7 → M8 → M9 → M12`. M1 feeds M2/M4; M4 supports M8; **M10 can parallelize from M3** in a worktree; M11 slots after M9. The single highest-leverage checkpoint is **G-M6** (vertical slice) — it converts architectural risk into a proven foundation.

## WHAT: Frame the Problem
Problem solving begins with framing. Framing is critical because the way a problem is defined strongly influences how it is understood and therefore how it will be solved. If the frame is flawed, the rest of the effort may be built on a weak foundation.

The structure of the map should be MECE: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. The answers themselves should be independent and collectively exhaustive. Teams are encouraged to generate possible answers before committing to a structure, defer criticism during generation, and continue drilling only while additional detail brings practical value. A map should be insightful, not merely exhaustive. Teams should ask the "so what?" question to judge whether a branch actually improves understanding.

A project charter should summarize the project's critical information. Stakeholders should understand what the project will deliver, what it will not deliver, how long it will take, how much it will cost, what benefits it should create, what drawbacks it should eliminate, and how it will be completed. Clear agreement on these points prevents scope creep and misunderstandings.

# Knowledge Router Agent — Complete Specification & Implementation Guide
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-06-06  
**Status:** Production-Ready Spec (Rethought across research papers, best practices, and your specific use cases)  
**Domains:** AI Filmmaking (text-to-video, consistency, cinematic pipelines) + AI Agents (multi-agent orchestration, advanced RAG, self-improving systems)  
**Philosophy:** Spec-driven, critic-loop heavy, hybrid deterministic + learned routing, fully traceable, continuously improving.

The **Knowledge Router Agent** is the central intelligence layer that ensures every specialized agent in your system (Character Consistency Critic, Video Prompt Optimizer, Multi-Agent Orchestrator Designer, Shot Planning Agent, etc.) receives **precisely the right knowledge** from your growing ~5,000-file `.md` corpus — with minimal noise, high precision, and strong explainability.

**Core Innovations in This Design**
- **Hybrid Routing Stack** (Metadata-first → Cluster/Centroid semantic → Graph traversal → LLM ranker with reflection)
- **Dual Planner + Router** for complex multi-hop creative/technical pipelines
- **Built-in Multi-Level Critic** (retrieval quality, routing decision, downstream utility) inspired by Self-RAG
- **Performance-Supervised Improvement** (soft labels from actual agent success, like AgentRouter)
- **Traceable + Explainable** by design
- **Training-free bootstrap** (RopMura style) with optional learned components
- **Domain packs** for your key agents (Character Consistency, Prompt Engineering for Video, Agentic Video Production, etc.)

**Success Criteria (Quality Gates)**
- Retrieval precision (relevant files returned in top results): ≥ 88% (critic or human eval)
- Routing decision quality (downstream agent success improvement): measurable lift
- Latency: < 4s p95 for standard queries; < 8s for complex pipeline queries
- Explainability: 100% of decisions produce human-readable + structured trace
- Continuous improvement: Routing accuracy improves over time via critic feedback and performance signals
- Cost efficiency: Avoids over-retrieval; supports cost-aware routing

   └── Optional Pre-computed Centroids per Domain/Agent Cluster
```

**Key Design Principles**
- **Metadata First**: Hard constraints eliminate 70-80% of irrelevant files instantly.
- **Graph-Guided Intelligence**: Relationships between concepts (e.g., “character consistency techniques improve multi-shot narrative in Seedance”) enable smarter routing.
- **Iterative Refinement**: For complex queries (full AI video production pipeline), Planner + iterative evaluation/simplification (RopMura style).
- **Self-Reflection**: The Router itself uses reflection tokens / critic steps (Self-RAG inspired) to judge its own retrieval quality before finalizing output.
- **Generalized + Extensible**: Core logic is domain-agnostic; domain packs and agent_relevance tags make it powerful for your AI Filmmaking + AI Agents corpus.

4. **LLM Ranker + Reflection** (Self-RAG / CRAG inspired)
   - Scores candidates on relevance to task + previous_failures + constraints.
   - Reflection step: “Are these passages actually useful for the downstream agent’s goal?” “Is anything critical missing?”
   - Can trigger corrective re-retrieval if quality low.

### 4.4 Context Assembler
- Options: raw top chunks | synthesized summary | structured knowledge pack (best for your critic-heavy agents).
- For creative agents: often returns “Knowledge Pack” with sections like Best Practices, Failure Modes & Mitigations, Tool-Specific Notes, Prompt Templates.

### 4.5 Explainer & Traceability
Every output includes a clear `reasoning_trace` (structured + natural language). This is non-negotiable for debugging and critic loops.

### 4.6 Multi-Level Critic (Self-Improving Core)
Three levels:
1. **Retrieval Critic**: Scores relevance, coverage of required_concepts, handling of previous_failures.
2. **Routing Critic**: Judges whether the right files were chosen vs alternatives; suggests better tags or graph edges.
3. **Downstream Utility Critic**: (Ideal) Observes or gets feedback from the requesting agent after it uses the context (“Did this knowledge help you succeed? What was missing?”). Feeds back as soft supervision signal (like AgentRouter’s F1-based training targets).

### Use Case 1: Character Consistency Critic Agent
**Request Example**: See Input contract above (wuxia fight scene).

**Router Behavior**:
- Hard filter: `tags CONTAIN character_consistency AND multi_shot`
- Graph: Pulls “clothing_drift” failure mode nodes + mitigation techniques
- Returns structured pack: “Best reference sheet practices for Seedance + Kling”, “Lighting-induced color shift mitigations”, “Multi-shot coherence checklist”
- Critic checks coverage of “previous_failures”

**Phase 1 (MVP – 7–14 days)**
- Metadata hard filters + basic vector search
- Simple Query Analyzer
- Basic Context Assembler + Explainer
- Manual / lightweight critic feedback loop
- Bootstrap with your existing top 500–1000 high-quality files

**Phase 2 (Production Core)**
- Add Cluster/Centroid layer (RopMura style)
- Lightweight Graph Explorer (traversal first, small GNN later)
- Planner for pipeline queries
- Structured Knowledge Pack output
- Automated Critic (levels 1–2)

**Phase 3 (Learning System)**
- Performance signal feedback loop (downstream agent success → soft labels)
- Optional small RouterGNN (AgentRouter style) trained on your data
- Proactive suggestions / push mode
- Full self-improvement via critic + usage analytics

**Phase 4 (Advanced)**
- Cost/latency-aware routing
- Multi-modal support (if you add image/video references to knowledge base)
- Integration with your full N1ch01as Architect harness + main Critic Agent

- **Offline**: Golden test set of 50–100 representative queries per major agent role. Measure precision@K, recall of required_concepts, critic scores.
- **Online**: Track downstream agent success rate before/after Router improvements. Log critic scores and human spot-checks.
- **Ablation**: Test impact of each layer (metadata only vs +graph vs +reflection).
- **Continuous**: Router critic proposes improvements to the knowledge base itself (new tags, missing content detection).

- **Very broad query** → Planner forces decomposition + strict max_files.
- **No good matches** → Router returns “Insufficient high-quality knowledge” + suggestions to expand corpus + low confidence flag.
- **Conflicting information** across files → Graph + Critic prioritize higher quality_score + more recent + explicit failure mode coverage.
- **New agent role appears** → Easy extension: add to `agent_relevance` tags; Router gradually learns via feedback.
- **Latency spikes on complex queries** → Planner has round limits; fallback to simpler retrieval.

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph or your custom harness (excellent for stateful Planner + Router + Critic loops)
- **Vector + Metadata**: LlamaIndex or Haystack with Qdrant/Pinecone (strong metadata filtering)

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA).  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces) to prevent drift. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself.  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

This is **spec-driven, critic-ready input**. Coding agent: Parse sections, generate code module-by-module, run internal critic/refinement loops on outputs, validate against success criteria before proceeding. Use `task.md` / `todo.md` style internally during build.

### Primary Objective
Implement a **controlled, hierarchical, ReAct-inspired agent loop system** that is:
- Reliable against known MAS failure modes (MASFT taxonomy).
- Evolvable via TEA-inspired versioning, tracing, and self-reflection/TextGrad-style optimization.
- Hybrid: Client-side full control + optional delegation to xAI server-side multi-agent for deep research.
- Production-grade: Observable, cost-aware, secure (sandboxed), testable, extensible.
- Aligned with user's preferences: Spec-driven (living `TaskSpec`), iterative refinement/critic loops, harness engineering, local/minimal-Docker, Python-first with Pydantic/JSON contracts, integration points for existing tools (xAI API, DeepSeek, Cursor/Kiro, self-hosted services).

**Key Findings & Mitigations Integrated**:
- Design/spec quality is #1 ROI. **Phase 0 mandatory**: Structured `TaskSpec` (Pydantic) with explicit objective, success_criteria list, constraints (max_steps, budgets), output_format, quality_gates. Automated spec validator + critic before loop start. Role contracts in delegation.
- Verification is weak spot even in "successful" runs. **Phase 3 + 5**: Dedicated Verifier/Critic agent (strict JSON: passes, score, issues, suggestions, confidence). Multi-level (low-level schema + high-level objective alignment). Explicit `Done` action that **must** pass verifier + evidence check. Progress tracking (% todo complete + criteria alignment in Thought step).
- Context/history loss & repetition common. **Phase 1**: Aggressive summarization on context > threshold, structured state (`task.md` / `todo.md` + key_facts only, not full history dump), cycle detection via recent action+obs hash (md5), `max_steps` hard cap + progress-based early exit.
- Inter-agent issues: Strong central Orchestrator with explicit decomposition/routing/contracts + structured handoff Observation schema (status, data, summary, confidence, issues, next_suggestions, provenance, trace_id). Circuit breakers per tool/role. Versioned shared state.
- Interventions in paper (+9-15% gains): Better prompts/roles/topology + verification sections. Our system goes further with **runtime gates + evolution**.

### 2.3 ReAct Foundations + Enhancements
- **ReAct (Yao et al. ICLR 2023)**: Thought (reasoning trace) → Action (tool/delegate/finish) → Observation (grounded result) loop. 10-34% gains on interactive tasks vs pure CoT or acting. Our core: Strict structured decision output (Pydantic: thought, action_type, payload), structured Observation always.
- **Enhancements Incorporated**:
  - **Reflexion** (Shinn et al.): Verbal self-critique on trajectories → improvement plans. Used in light reflection (every N steps) + full Phase 4.
  - **Prospector** (Kim et al.): Self-Asking + Trajectory Ranking. Optional: Generate multiple candidate trajectories, rank via critic, pick best.
  - **ReflAct** (recent): Strengthens grounding **in the reasoning step itself** (retouches reasoning with world feedback). Enhance Thought prompt to explicitly re-ground vs previous obs + original objective.
  - **Plan-and-Execute + LATS/MetaGPT patterns**: Explicit high-level plan phase (Phase 0 optional) before loop; tree search elements via multiple parallel sub-branches (optional in hierarchical).
- **xAI Production Patterns**: Server-side ReAct loop (model decides tools → executes internally → iterates until final). Multi-agent: realtime parallel specialists + leader synthesis (4 or 16 agents controlled by `reasoning.effort`). Grok Build: Plan-first, parallel sub-agents (isolated contexts/worktrees), structured workflow, ACP support for custom orchestration. **Our Hybrid**: Client orchestrator maintains global state/trace/verifier; delegates research sub-problems to xAI multi-agent (narrow spec, receive synthesized + citations); for coding sub-tasks, use local specialists or emulate parallel in isolated Python processes/threads with copied state slices.

**Rationale Summary**: This design directly attacks the #1 failure category (spec/design) via Phase 0 + living TaskSpec + critic. Closes verification gaps with mandatory gates + structured obs. Prevents loops/context rot with detection + summarization + structured state (todo.md pattern user prefers). Enables long-term robustness via TEA self-evolution. Leverages xAI strengths without ceding control. Matches user's iterative, spec-driven, production harness philosophy.

### 3.1 High-Level Flow (Phases from agent_loop.md, Hardened)
1. **Phase 0: Initialization**
   - Parse instruction → generate/validate `TaskSpec` (Pydantic: objective, success_criteria: List[str], constraints: Dict, output_format, max_steps=50, token_budget=200k, quality_gates, initial_plan?).
   - Spec Validator + Critic (LLM): Check completeness, ambiguity, role clarity, termination conditions. Reject/revise if FM-1.x risks high.
   - Create `AgentState`: task_spec, todo (from plan or empty), memory, tracer, version_registry, budgets, seen_hashes=set().
   - Optional: Planner LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps + deps) + todo.md content. Validate plan vs spec.
   - Decide architecture: flat | hierarchical | hybrid_xai.

4. **Phase 3: Consolidation & Quality Gates**
   - Aggregator collects observations + plan progress.
   - Harmonizer/Reporter LLM: Merge, dedup, cross-reference, resolve conflicts (cite sources/versions), produce unified draft.
   - Verifier/Critic: Score vs success_criteria, check hallucinations/gaps/FM-3.x issues, suggest fixes. JSON output.
   - If fail gate: Trigger refinement (re-plan specific branch, re-delegate, or self-edit).
   - If pass: Proceed to polish or final.

### 3.3 Key Modules to Implement (with Skeletons from attached + Enhancements)
- **core/loop.py**: `controlled_react_loop` (enhance attached code with Pydantic, full state, MASFT-aware prompts, xAI hybrid hooks, progress tracking).
- **reliability/circuit_breaker.py**: Enhanced class with metrics, per-tool/role instances, integration with safe_execute.
- **reliability/verifier.py**: `verify_output` + `VERIFIER_PROMPT` tuned to catch FM-1.x/2.x/3.x (e.g., "Does this respect original task_spec and roles? Any premature termination or incomplete verification? Cross-check claims vs observations.").
- **hierarchical/orchestrator.py**: Planner logic, delegation router, sub-agent factory, consolidator.
- **evolution/self_evolver.py**: `self_evolve_component` (TextGrad-style: diagnose from trace, propose_edit, validate_improvement, VersionManager.register).
- **tea/protocol.py**: Minimal TCP/ECP/ACP schemas, register_tool/register_agent, get_context_slice, VersionManager.
- **integrations/xai.py**: `call_grok_multi_agent(sub_spec, tools_enabled, context_slice)` → parse leader result into StructuredObservation.
- **memory/ & tracing/**: As described.
- **prompts/**: Versioned JSON/YAML or .md files for system prompts, few-shots (ReAct decision, verifier, planner, reflector, sub-roles). Include MASFT failure mode references in critic prompts.

**Coding Agent Workflow During Build**: After each phase/module, generate code → run internal critic (use verifier logic or separate reflection prompt) → fix issues → re-validate against gate criteria → proceed. Maintain `build_task.md` / `todo.md` internally. Log all to tracer for later self-evolution of the builder itself.

## 6. Testing & Validation Strategy (Critical for Coding Agent)

**Recommended First Prompt to Coding Agent (copy-paste)**:
"Read `agent_loop_creator.md` and `agent_loop.md` fully. Create the `agent_loop/` Python package scaffold with pyproject.toml, core Pydantic models (TaskSpec, StructuredObservation, etc.), basic LLM client, and a minimal working controlled ReAct loop that passes the Phase 0/1 verification gates. Use strict JSON schemas. Include initial failure_injection test skeleton for MASFT modes. Maintain todo.md during your work and apply critic/refinement to every generated module."

**Questions for Clarification (if needed before coding)**: None anticipated — spec is self-contained. If ambiguities arise during build, resolve via internal critic or escalate with specific trace.

This completes the deep research + implementation spec. Build it production-grade, iterate with critics, and make it a cornerstone of advanced agent harnesses.



### From `corpus/root/agent_loop_creator_v2.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/agent_loop_creator_v2.md`.


**Key v2 Additions (from agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4)**: Explicit Cynefin context classification for adaptive Fast vs Full loop routing; mandatory Premortem in Phase 0; RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition for Fast Recognition Path in Phase 1; structured AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys/Fishbone + multi-perspective critics (Paul-Elder/Red Team/Six Hats) in Phase 4 reflection/self-evolution. All original v1 details, skeletons, MASFT mappings, and phased roadmap preserved and extended.

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration + Cognitive Layer):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA). **v2 addition**: Human cognitive frameworks (top-ranked in thinking_model.md) provide the highest-leverage missing layer for adaptive intelligence, proactive risk handling, fast/slow deliberation, and multi-level learning — directly mapped in agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4.  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency. Cognitive routing (Cynefin) helps decide when to delegate vs local fast path.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization + **Pattern Store for RPD**) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces + **AAR/Double-Loop structure**) to prevent drift. **Cognitive config** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, critic_modes) per TaskSpec for adaptability without complexity explosion on simple tasks. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself (including its own cognitive components).  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3) **+ cognitive mitigations** (e.g., Premortem for spec/design risks, Metacognition + cycle detection for repetition, AAR/Double-Loop for verification/termination gaps, RPD for context/history issues via pattern matching).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Controlled core with cognitive mode selection (Fast Recognition Path) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution + full AAR/Double-Loop/5Whys critics → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; **cognitive features validated** (Cynefin classification accuracy, Premortem risk coverage, RPD hit rate on repeated tasks, AAR structure compliance, Double-Loop assumption questioning); full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

This is **spec-driven, critic-ready input**. Coding agent: Parse sections, generate code module-by-module, run internal critic/refinement loops on outputs, validate against success criteria before proceeding. Use `task.md` / `todo.md` style internally during build.

### Primary Objective
Implement a **controlled, hierarchical, ReAct-inspired agent loop system (v3 Cognitive-Enhanced)** that is:
- Reliable against known MAS failure modes (MASFT taxonomy) **and enhanced with human cognitive best practices** (adaptive context routing via Cynefin, proactive risk via Premortem, fast expert intuition via RPD + Dual Process, structured multi-level reflection via AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys, multi-perspective critique via Paul-Elder/Red Team).
- Evolvable via TEA-inspired versioning, tracing, and self-reflection/TextGrad-style optimization **structured as AAR + Double-Loop**.
- Hybrid: Client-side full control + optional delegation to xAI server-side multi-agent for deep research **with cognitive mode selection** (Fast Recognition Path for routine sub-tasks vs Full deliberative for complex).
- Production-grade: Observable, cost-aware, secure (sandboxed), testable, extensible, **with configurable cognitive_profile** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style="aar_double_loop_5whys", critic_modes=["red_team", "paul_elder"]).
- Aligned with user's preferences: Spec-driven (living `TaskSpec` with cognitive_profile), iterative refinement/critic loops, harness engineering, local/minimal-Docker, Python-first with Pydantic/JSON contracts, integration points for existing tools (xAI API, DeepSeek, Cursor/Kiro, self-hosted services). **Dogfood cognitive improvements on its own prompts/verifier during Phase 4**.

**v2 Cognitive Success Criteria (Additional)**:
9. **Adaptive Routing (Cynefin + RPD + Dual Process)**: On mixed-complexity task suites, correctly classifies context (Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic) with ≥85% agreement vs human baseline or held-out labels; Fast Recognition Path triggers on ≥70% of repeated/routine sub-tasks with pattern match (measured by RPD similarity + outcome quality); overall token reduction ≥20-30% vs always-full baseline without quality loss on simple cases.
10. **Proactive Risk (Premortem)**: In Phase 0, Premortem step identifies ≥3-5 plausible failure modes per complex task and incorporates mitigations into spec/todo/quality_gates; demonstrable reduction in downstream FM-1.x/3.x issues in failure-injection tests.
11. **Structured Reflection & Deep Learning (AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys)**: Phase 4 reflections produce complete AAR artifacts (4 questions answered with evidence); Double-Loop questions governing variables and proposes meta-changes (e.g., prompt/schema evolution) that pass validation in ≥60% of bounded rounds; 5 Whys + Fishbone categorization used on ≥80% of diagnosed failures with actionable root causes.
12. **Multi-Perspective Critique (Paul-Elder / Red Team / Six Hats)**: Verifier supports critic_modes; ensemble or red_team/paul_elder modes catch ≥15% more issues (esp. assumption, bias, edge-case) than standard mode alone on held-out bad outputs; Six Hats or equivalent used in creative/harmonization steps when configured.

**Key Findings & Mitigations Integrated**:
- Design/spec quality is #1 ROI. **Phase 0 mandatory**: Structured `TaskSpec` (Pydantic) with explicit objective, success_criteria list, constraints (max_steps, budgets), output_format, quality_gates. Automated spec validator + critic before loop start. Role contracts in delegation.
- Verification is weak spot even in "successful" runs. **Phase 3 + 5**: Dedicated Verifier/Critic agent (strict JSON: passes, score, issues, suggestions, confidence). Multi-level (low-level schema + high-level objective alignment). Explicit `Done` action that **must** pass verifier + evidence check. Progress tracking (% todo complete + criteria alignment in Thought step).
- Context/history loss & repetition common. **Phase 1**: Aggressive summarization on context > threshold, structured state (`task.md` / `todo.md` + key_facts only, not full history dump), cycle detection via recent action+obs hash (md5), `max_steps` hard cap + progress-based early exit.
- Inter-agent issues: Strong central Orchestrator with explicit decomposition/routing/contracts + structured handoff Observation schema (status, data, summary, confidence, issues, next_suggestions, provenance, trace_id). Circuit breakers per tool/role. Versioned shared state.
- Interventions in paper (+9-15% gains): Better prompts/roles/topology + verification sections. Our system goes further with **runtime gates + evolution**.

  - **ReflAct** (recent): Strengthens grounding **in the reasoning step itself** (retouches reasoning with world feedback). Enhance Thought prompt to explicitly re-ground vs previous obs + original objective.
  - **Plan-and-Execute + LATS/MetaGPT patterns**: Explicit high-level plan phase (Phase 0 optional) before loop; tree search elements via multiple parallel sub-branches (optional in hierarchical).
- **xAI Production Patterns**: Server-side ReAct loop (model decides tools → executes internally → iterates until final). Multi-agent: realtime parallel specialists + leader synthesis (4 or 16 agents controlled by `reasoning.effort`).

**Rationale Summary**: This design directly attacks the #1 failure category (spec/design) via Phase 0 + living TaskSpec + critic. Closes verification gaps with mandatory gates + structured obs. Prevents loops/context rot with detection + summarization + structured state (todo.md pattern user prefers). Enables long-term robustness via TEA self-evolution. Leverages xAI strengths without ceding control. Matches user's iterative, spec-driven, production harness philosophy.

### 3.1 High-Level Flow (Phases from agent_loop_v3.md, Hardened with Cognitive Layer)
1. **Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven + Cognitive Setup)**
   - Parse instruction → generate/validate `TaskSpec` (Pydantic: objective, success_criteria: List[str], constraints: Dict, output_format, max_steps=50, token_budget=200k, quality_gates, initial_plan?, **cognitive_profile: Dict** e.g. {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "auto"}).
   - Spec Validator + Critic (LLM): Check completeness, ambiguity, role clarity, termination conditions. Reject/revise if FM-1.x risks high. **Run Premortem Analysis**: "Assume this spec/plan fails spectacularly — identify top causes and mitigations; merge into living spec, success_criteria, todo, and quality_gates."
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): Tag task context (Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic) based on cause-effect clarity, expertise needed, emergence, or crisis. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop params (Fast path preference for Simple/Complicated; Full + heavy reflection for Complex/Chaotic).
   - Create `AgentState`: task_spec (with cognitive_profile + cynefin_tag), todo (from plan or empty), memory (incl. Pattern Store for RPD), tracer, version_registry, budgets, seen_hashes=set(), **current_mode: "fast" | "full"**.
   - Optional: Planner LLM generates high-level plan (numbered

**Context & Principles**  
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** first: Clear specs drive everything.  
- Prioritize **highest-ranked** items on feature/skill/rule overlap (ECC #1 > Karpathy rules #2 > claude-mem #3 > shanraisshan best-practice #4 > antigravity-awesome-skills #5, etc.).  
- Keep it **portable, minimal-Docker where possible, local-first**, with excellent security, memory, and token efficiency.  
- Output must be **agent-friendly**: clear phases, checklists, acceptance criteria, and hooks for critic/review agents.  
- Support iterative refinement (plan → implement → review → improve loops).  
- Target users: Solo developers, small teams, or power users building custom AI coding workflows (aligns with harness engineering + N1ch01as-style meta-systems).

## Self-Evaluation & Critic Routine (Agent Self-Quality Assessment) — Research-Enhanced

This section is significantly strengthened based on deep research from xAI (Grok multi-agent capabilities, Grok Build agentic coding focus, transparent/auditable reasoning) and high-quality 2025–2026 research (Reflexion, Self-Refine, SAGE multi-agent self-evolution, SCALAR Structured Critic–Actor Loop, human-in-the-loop self-improvement frameworks, context folding/memory architectures).

**Research-Backed Design Principles**
- **Multi-agent critic patterns** (xAI Grok Multi-Agent + SAGE): Use specialized roles (Actor/Solver + Critic/Challenger + optional Judge) that can work in parallel. Each sub-agent shows its reasoning for full auditability and transparency.
- **Structured self-critique** (SCALAR, Reflexion, Self-Refine): Move beyond vague feedback. Use explicit verification of preconditions, state tracking, rubric scoring, and episodic memory of past reflections/critiques.
- **Human-in-the-loop safety** (strong research consensus): All high-impact changes require human confirmation. Optional human guidance when domain knowledge evolves rapidly.
- **Memory & context management**: Support hierarchical summaries, reflection storage, and context folding for long-horizon tasks (enhancing claude-mem with ideas from AgentFold / Recursive Language Models research).
- **Transparency & auditability** (core xAI philosophy): Every sub-agent reasoning step, critique, and decision is logged and reviewable.
- **ECC-first + Research layer**: Start with ECC’s existing review/critique capabilities as the foundation, then layer on stronger multi-agent critic loops and structured reflection.

**Core Routine Flow** (Actor → Multi-Agent Critic → Refine + Memory loop)
- **Actor/Solver**: Generates the implementation or solution using ECC skills + Karpathy rules.
- **Critic/Challenger** (can be multi-agent): Runs structured self-critique using the enhanced rubric. Can spawn parallel sub-agents for deeper analysis on different dimensions (e.g., one for security, one for simplicity). Produces scores + specific issues + concrete, actionable improvement suggestions.
- **Reflection Storage**: Critiques, lessons learned, and successful patterns are stored in episodic memory (build on claude-mem or add dedicated structured reflection store with hierarchical summaries).
- **Refine Loop**: Actor uses the critique + stored reflections to improve the output. Supports multiple iterations with intelligent context management.
- **Human Confirmation Gate**: High-impact suggestions (especially skill/rule changes) go through the human confirmation workflow.
- **Full Audit Log**: All reasoning traces, critiques, and decisions are recorded for transparency and later review (xAI-style auditability).

**Design (ECC-first + Extensible)**
- Central critic skill(s) in `./skills/critic/` (or reuse/extend ECC’s existing review/critique capabilities).
- Structured self-evaluation prompt/template that outputs:
  - Overall quality score (e.g., 1–10 or rubric-based)
  - Breakdown across dimensions (Correctness, Simplicity/Karpathy alignment, Spec adherence, Security, Performance, Maintainability, Token efficiency)
  - Specific issues found
  - Concrete improvement suggestions (as new tasks or diff recommendations)
- Can be triggered:
  - Automatically via post-completion hook
  - Manually with `/self-review` or `/critic` command
  - As part of multi-step workflows (after implementing a feature spec)
- Output stored alongside the work (e.g., `review.md` or appended to `task.md` / `status.md`)
- Feeds back into the loop (agent can then refine based on its own critique)

**Tasks to Implement**
1. [ ] Create or adapt a core **critic / self-review skill** in `./skills/critic/self-review.md` (start with ECC’s review capabilities as base, enhance with Karpathy + best-practice patterns).
2. [ ] Define a reusable **self-evaluation prompt template** (in `rules/` or `skills/critic/`) that agents can invoke.
3. [ ] Add a **slash command** (e.g., `/self-review` or `/critic`) in `.claude/commands/` that triggers structured self-evaluation on the current context or last changes.
4. [ ] Create a **post-completion hook** that optionally runs self-review after significant code changes or task completion.
5. [ ] Make the routine output structured data (Markdown + optional JSON) that can be parsed by other agents or scripts.
6. [ ] Integrate with existing orchestration (e.g., after dmux parallel work or feature implementation from a spec).
7. [ ] Add example usage in `docs/usage.md` and a sample `examples/self-review-workflow/`.
8. [ ] Allow customization of the rubric (e.g., project-specific weights or extra dimensions like accessibility, i18n).
9. [ ] Ensure the critic routine itself can be self-evaluated (meta level) for continuous improvement of the harness.

This builds directly on the Self-Evaluation & Critic Routine and the central `skills/` source of truth.

**Core Workflow (Human-in-the-Loop)**
1. **Analysis Phase** (triggered by critic, periodic review, or after completing significant work):
   - Agent analyzes current skill usage, quality scores from self-reviews, relevance to recent tasks, duplication, or gaps.
   - Uses high-ranking sources (ECC patterns first, then best-practice insights).
2. **Suggestion Generation**:
   - Produces clear, structured suggestions:
     - **Add**: New skill proposal (name, purpose, source or draft content, why it's valuable).
     - **Update**: Specific improvements to an existing skill (with diff or before/after summary).
     - **Remove**: Reason for removal (low usage, superseded, quality issues) + impact assessment.
   - Suggestions are saved to a `suggestions/` folder or `pending-skill-changes.md` with unique IDs.
3. **Human Review & Confirmation**:
   - Human reviews the suggestions (via file, dashboard, or agent command like `/review-suggestions`).
   - Human confirms, rejects, or modifies (e.g., edits the suggestion file or replies with approval).
   - Only confirmed items proceed.
4. **Safe Application**:
   - After confirmation, the change is applied to the central `skills/` (and `rules/` if relevant).
   - The Cross-Agent Sync Layer then propagates the update to all agents' folders (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.).
5. **Audit & Rollback**:
   - All changes are logged with timestamp, reason, and human approver.
   - Easy rollback via git or a dedicated undo mechanism.

**Tasks to Implement**
1. [ ] Create a **suggestion generator skill** (or extend the critic routine) that can propose add/update/remove actions based on analysis.
2. [ ] Define a standard **suggestion format** (Markdown template with sections: Action, Skill Name, Rationale, Impact, Proposed Content/Diff, Confidence).
3. [ ] Add storage for pending suggestions (`suggestions/` folder + manifest or `pending-skill-changes.md`).
4. [ ] Create slash commands:
   - `/suggest-skills` — trigger analysis and generate new suggestions.
   - `/review-suggestions` — list pending suggestions with details.
   - `/approve-suggestion ` or `/confirm-changes` — human confirmation step.
5. [ ] Integrate with the Self-Evaluation routine so strong critiques can automatically trigger relevant suggestions.
6. [ ] After human confirmation, automatically apply the change to central `skills/` and trigger the sync layer.
7. [ ] Add logging/audit trail for all confirmed changes.
8. [ ] Document the full workflow in `docs/usage.md` with examples.
9. [ ] Make the suggestion system itself self-evaluable (meta-critic).

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Write excellent `docs/`:
- `README.md` with quick start, architecture overview, ranking rationale.
- `installation.md` with exact commands.
- `usage.md` with example workflows (plan a feature with SDD, parallel agents via task.md, security review, etc.).
2. [ ] Add 2–3 example mini-projects or workflow demos in `examples/`.
3. [ ] Implement quality gates:
- Automated lint / security scan on changes.
- Review prompt or agent command for PRs/changes.
- Self-test script that verifies core commands work.
4. [ ] Add this `task.md` (and future task tracking) as the living spec.
5. [ ] Create critic/review agent prompt or skill for ongoing improvement of the harness itself.

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Add self-improvement loop skill (research new skills → propose additions → critic review → merge).
2. [ ] Support easy updates from upstream (ECC, skill libraries) via scripts.
3. [ ] Include placeholders for domain-specific extensions (e.g., trading skills, frontend design, Django/TS stacks).
4. [ ] Plan for multi-agent orchestration examples using ECC's dmux + task.md pattern.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clear path to evolve the starter without breaking existing setups.
- Supports your preferred iterative refinement + critic agent workflow.

- **Always start with planning/spec phase** (use ECC planning skills or new SDD skills).
- **Use high-ranking source first** on any overlap.
- **Generate task.md / status.md** for complex sub-tasks (following ECC dmux pattern).
- **Run critic/review** after major phases.
- **Track cost/token usage** throughout.
- **Security scan** before any merge or publish.
- **Document decisions** in `docs/decisions.md`.

This task.md itself serves as the living **spec** for the project. Update it as we progress (or let a critic agent propose improvements).

## 13. Phase 7 — Self-Evaluation and Critic Routine

- **Actor/Solver:** Implements the task.  
- **Critic:** Reviews correctness, simplicity, spec adherence, security, performance, maintainability.  
- **Security Critic:** Optional focused security pass.  
- **Test Critic:** Optional test and verification pass.  
- **Judge:** Summarizes blocking vs non-blocking findings.

- [ ] Claude skill/command: `/self-review`  
- [ ] Claude skill/command: `/critic`  
- [ ] CLI: `npm run review`  
- [ ] Optional hook: post-task self-review

- [ ] `npm run security` runs locally.  
- [ ] Critical findings fail CI.  
- [ ] Sensitive files are protected.  
- [ ] Security docs explain the model.

- [ ] `npm run init` creates a working starter.  
- [ ] `npm run sync` updates all supported agent configs.  
- [ ] Claude Code, Cursor, and at least one of Codex/Gemini/OpenCode are verified.  
- [ ] ECC foundation is installed/adapted and documented.  
- [ ] Karpathy behavior rules are active.  
- [ ] Self-review workflow works.  
- [ ] Skill suggestions require human approval.  
- [ ] Security scan works and blocks critical issues.  
- [ ] Docs are sufficient for a new user.  
- [ ] All generated files are reproducible.  
- [ ] Source audit and decisions are complete.  
- [ ] All project names, docs, generated headers, scripts, and examples consistently use `project_starter`.

1. **Foundation:** repo, CLI, manifests, docs skeleton.  
2. **Sync:** central source → Claude/Cursor/Codex.  
3. **ECC:** install/adapt core.  
4. **Rules:** constitution + Karpathy + SDD.  
5. **Skills:** curated core.  
6. **Security:** AgentShield + secret protections.  
7. **Memory:** handoff + reflection.  
8. **Critic:** self-review workflow.  
9. **Lifecycle:** suggestions + human approval.
