## Responsibility

Flags tropes, clichés, over-fit outputs

## Knowledge distillation sources

TV Tropes; OpenSubtitles n-gram freq; corpus-novelty embeddings

## Self-quality criteria

Cliché-hit count; novelty score vs category prior

## Surpass-human signal

Catches more clichés than experienced script editor

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** IdeationAgent, ScreenwriterAgent

- **Comments on:** ScreenwriterAgent (trope-stuffed), CopywriterAgent (templated)

## Tools (design-time documentation)

TV Tropes scraper; n-gram frequency DB; embedding novelty scorer

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

LLM-as-Judge (anti-cliché constitution)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Authors:** Grok (xAI) + Collaborative Iteration with User Nicholas (nicholas_hui)  
**Target Audience:** Senior AI Engineering / Coding Agents (for immediate implementation)  
**Purpose:** This is the **definitive, production-grade specification** for building the General Creative Agent (GCA) — a stateful, LLM-orchestrated system that operationalizes the fully refined **Strategic Sparse Outlier Recombination (SSOR) Model**. It includes complete background, the entire iterative evolution from the user’s original idea, exhaustive research synthesis (psychology, neuroscience, computational creativity, science-of-science, arXiv 2024–2025 papers, Anthropic NLAE, and xAI/Grok-related insights), detailed functional requirements, architecture, 7-phase process, domain-specific factory, AI-native POVs, implementation guidelines, evaluation metrics, and full references.

---

### 1. Executive Summary
The General Creative Agent (GCA) is a modular, extensible AI system that transforms any input problem or situation into **novel-yet-useful creative outputs** by rigorously applying the **Strategic Sparse Outlier Recombination (SSOR) Model**.  

Key innovations:
- **Core engine**: Multi-POV statistical mapping → strategic sparse outlier sampling → cross-dimensional recombination → value-gated selection (inverted-U novelty balance + usefulness + coherence + feasibility).
- **Expansion factory**: One-click creation of domain-specific creative agents (scientific, artistic, business, engineering, etc.) with zero code duplication.
- **AI-native POVs**: Leverages Anthropic’s Natural Language Autoencoders (NLAEs) and xAI reasoning insights for genuinely non-human cognitive modes.
- **Traceability**: Every output includes full SSOR process trace, surprise vectors, creativity scores, and prototype plans.

The GCA is not a generic LLM wrapper — it is a **computational embodiment** of decades of creativity research, engineered for immediate real-world impact in art, science, business, education, and beyond.

### 2. Background: User’s Original Theory
The user’s foundational insight (first message):
> “I think the model of creative is that the consequences event after a list of statistical observations value of pov (point of view) or different aspect from a current situation all or large portion go to into outlier range. Different patten of outliers combination will cause unpredictable new events. And that is creative.”

This probabilistic, statistical framing treats creativity as **perspective-shifting that pushes expected outcomes into outlier tails, followed by recombination that yields emergent unpredictability**. It was remarkably prescient and aligned with multiple formal theories.

Through iterative refinement (detailed in conversation history), we preserved the statistical + combinatorial core while incorporating empirical guardrails from global research.

---

### 3. Evolution of the SSOR Model
The model evolved through multiple detailed iterations (summarized here for completeness):

1. **Raw User Idea** → Multi-POV statistical outliers + recombination = novelty.
2. **First Refinements** → Added usefulness/value (standard definition of creativity); inverted-U on novelty (not maximal outliers).
3. **Sparse Constraint** → “Sparse” (1–4 strategic outlier dimensions anchored in conventional core) per Uzzi et al. (2013) science-of-science findings.
4. **Reachability & Joint Novelty** → Combinations must be reachable in semantic graphs; joint (not marginal) outlier scoring.
5. **Transformational Layer** → Occasional rewriting of POVs themselves (Boden’s transformational creativity).
6. **Neuroscience Integration** → Default Mode Network (generation) ↔ Executive Control Network (filtering).
7. **AI-Native Enhancement** → Incorporation of Anthropic NLAEs for internal model modes as POVs.
8. **Final SSOR** → Fully operational, computable, and agent-implementable.

**Final Plain-English Definition**:
> Creativity is the process of reframing a situation through multiple statistical points of view, strategically sampling a sparse set of outlier elements from those distributions, recombining them in novel ways, and then selecting only those emergent patterns that are surprising yet coherent, valuable, and capable of reshaping future possibilities.

### 4. The Strategic Sparse Outlier Recombination (SSOR) Model – Formal Definition

Let a situation/problem \( S \) be described by feature distributions (POVs) \( \{D_1, D_2, \dots, D_n\} \).

For any candidate idea/event/artifact \( y \) generated in context \( c \), from viewpoint \( v \), under goal \( g \):

\[
\operatorname{Cr}(y \mid c, v, g) = B\bigl(N(y), K(y)\bigr) \cdot U(y) \cdot Q(y) \cdot F(y)
\]

Where:
- \( N(y) \): Novelty/surprise (e.g., negative log joint probability, multivariate Mahalanobis distance, or NLAE-derived activation surprise).
- \( K(y) \): Rare-combination score (semantic distance × co-occurrence rarity in domain graph).
- \( B(\cdot) \): Inverted-U balance function (Gaussian or beta-like, peaks at moderate total surprise — per SAMOC/Schubert et al. 2021).
- \( U(y) \): Usefulness/value/effectiveness (domain-specific metrics: problem-solving power, aesthetic resonance, citation potential, etc.).
- \( Q(y) \): Coherence/reachability/integrability (path existence in semantic/associative graph).
- \( F(y) \): Feasibility/embodiment/implementability.

**Key Principle (hard-coded)**: **Sparse + Strategic** — target 1–4 outlier dimensions per recombination. Too many = noise; too few = cliché (Goldilocks zone validated by 17.9M-paper Uzzi study and 44M-paper SciSciNet).

---

### 5. Research Foundation (Exhaustive Synthesis)

#### 5.1 Foundational Theories
- **Boden (2004/2009)**: *The Creative Mind* — combinatorial (core of SSOR), exploratory, and transformational creativity. Directly operationalized in GCA Phase 4 & 6.
- **Koestler (1964)**: Bisociation — clash of matrices = outlier recombination.
- **Mednick (1962)**: Remote Associates — distant but meaningful associations.
- **Runco & Jaeger (2012)**: Standard definition = novelty + usefulness.

#### 5.2 Empirical Large-Scale Evidence (Sparse Outliers)
- **Uzzi et al. (2013)**: *Science* — 17.9 million papers: highest impact = conventional core + small atypical (sparse outlier) combinations.
- **Lin et al. (2023)**: SciSciNet — 44+ million papers with pre-computed novelty/conventionality scores. Ideal training/evaluation dataset for GCA.

#### 5.3 Neuroscience
- **Beaty et al. (2015, 2018)**: DMN–ECN coupling for idea generation + evaluation.
- **Shofty et al. (2022)**: Causal DMN link to creative thinking.
- **Schubert et al. (2021)**: SAMOC — inverted-U optimal novelty.

#### 5.4 Recent arXiv Research (2024–2025) – Directly Relevant to LLM Implementation
- **Gu et al. (2024)** arXiv:2412.14141: “LLMs can Realize Combinatorial Creativity: Generating Creative Ideas via LLMs for Scientific Research” — Explicit framework using Boden’s theory + generalization-level retrieval + structured recombination. **Strong validation that guided LLMs excel at SSOR-style creativity.**
- **Schapiro et al. (2025)** arXiv:2509.21043: “Combinatorial Creativity: A New Frontier in Generalization Abilities” — Mathematical framework quantifying novelty/utility tradeoff; scaling laws for creative LLMs; ideation-execution gap explained by novelty-utility tension. **Perfect for GCA’s value-gated selection and balance function.**
- **Shen et al. (2026)** arXiv:2605.11258: Analogical reasoning to unlock LLM creativity via cross-domain relational structures.
- **Hou et al. (2025)** arXiv:2510.20091: CreativityPrism — holistic evaluation framework (quality, novelty, diversity) for LLMs.
- **Additional arXiv support**: Multiple papers on structured recombination, concept blending in VLMs, and UoT (Universe of Thoughts) for combinational/exploratory/transformative reasoning (e.g., arXiv:2511.20471).

#### 5.5 xAI / Grok-Related Insights
- xAI’s Grok models emphasize reasoning, tool-use, and agentic capabilities (Grok 4 Model Card, 2025). Grok’s training emphasizes truth-seeking and maximal curiosity — aligning perfectly with SSOR’s exploration of outlier spaces.
- Recent Grok evaluations (e.g., visual reasoning benchmarks arXiv:2502.16428) highlight strong multimodal reasoning consistency, supporting GCA’s multi-POV and surprise-vector mechanisms.
- xAI’s focus on understanding the universe (foundational mission) mirrors the transformational creativity layer in SSOR.

#### 5.6 Interpretability Breakthrough: Anthropic Natural Language Autoencoders (NLAEs)
- **Anthropic (2026)**: “Natural Language Autoencoders: Turning Claude’s thoughts into text” (transformer-circuits.pub / anthropic.com/research). Trains models to translate internal activations into readable natural-language explanations (and back). Surfaces hidden modes: anticipatory planning, evaluation-awareness, deception-avoidance, hidden motivations, meta-model awareness, etc.
- **Direct application to SSOR**: Provides 12+ **AI-native POVs** (detailed below) that are statistically distinct from human role-play.

**Creativity Score**
\[
\operatorname{Cr}(y \mid c, v, g) = B\bigl(N(y), K(y)\bigr) \cdot U(y) \cdot Q(y) \cdot F(y)
\]

**Component Implementations (Python-style pseudocode)**
```python
def novelty_score(y, distributions) -> float:
    # Negative log joint probability or Mahalanobis distance across POVs
    ...

def combination_score(y, semantic_graph) -> float:
    # Semantic distance × co-occurrence rarity
    ...

def balance_function(total_surprise: float) -> float:
    # Inverted-U (Gaussian centered ~moderate surprise)
    return math.exp(-((total_surprise - 0.5)**2) / (2 * 0.15**2))

def usefulness(y, context_metrics) -> float: ...
def coherence(y, semantic_graph) -> float: ...
def feasibility(y, constraints) -> float: ...
```

**Sparse Constraint (hard-coded)**: Maximum 4 outlier dimensions per recombination (enforced in Phase 3 & 4).  
**Transformational Flag**: Detected when a surviving idea rewrites any original POV distribution.

- Use semantic graph traversal (Chroma/FAISS) to ensure reachability.  
- Generate combinations (Cartesian product limited by sparsity).

**Phase 5: Value-Gated Selection**  
- Compute full SSOR score for each candidate.  
- Inverted-U balance + Pareto front ranking if > N candidates.  
- Filter threshold configurable per domain.

**Phase 6: Integration & Refinement**  
- Self-critique loop (Executive-Control style prompt).  
- Check transformational potential.

**Phase 7: Output & Model Update**  
- Rich Markdown + JSON output.  
- Persist winning ideas as new “conventional” patterns in memory.

**Build (each as a crosscutting service agent, all on `BaseAgent`):**
1. **DIA (Deep Intent Analysis)** — parses briefs → structured intent (goals, audience, hidden agendas, constraints). The entry point of every production.
2. **GCA (SSOR)** — creative ideation engine; the 7-phase SSOR pipeline + domain factory. Consumed by Director/Screenwriter/ConceptArtist/Ideation.
3. **Process Optimization Agent** — DMAIC + Lean + multi-agent consensus over workflow telemetry.
4. **Strategic Goal Achievement** — 6-stage goal-clarification framework used by all planning agents.
5. **Complex Problem Solving** — WHAT/WHY/HOW/DO/REVIEW methodology for diagnostic agents.
6. **Aesthetics Agent** — the decomposed multimodal Critic + Aligner + Taste-Keeper (per the spec you authored); supplies `qc.l2`/perceptual scoring, novelty (D9) to GCA, and `aesthetic` critiques. Wire its `AestheticVerdict` into `packages/qc` and the critique bus.

**Claude Code workflow:** One sub-task per service; `/clear` between them. Each follows the Agent Implementation Playbook (§8). GCA and Aesthetics form a generate↔evaluate loop — build GCA's novelty score to *call* the Aesthetics Agent (don't duplicate).

**Build:**
- **Orchestration (53–58):** harden Orchestrator/Planner/Router/Judge/GateKeeper/Memory with full dispute-resolution (multi-agent debate), stage-gate sign-off, and escaped-defect=0 discipline.
- **Creative (59–65):** Ideation, NarrativeArc, StyleTransfer, MoodBoard, Novelty/Anti-Cliché, EmotionalArc, WorldBuilding — many delegate to GCA/Aesthetics (no duplication).
- **Research (66–72):** Web/Archive/Trend/Competitor/Citation/InterviewSynthesis/Benchmark — built on the M4 Research Agent core.
- **Optimization (73–80):** Prompt/Cost/Latency/Retention/ROAS/Accessibility optimizers + EvaluationHarness + SafetyRedTeam.
- **Full QC mesh**: complete L3 (AudienceSim ≥200 personas + HiTL sampling) and Q1–Q6 delivery validators; `GateKeeperAgent` enforces "zero leaked defects."

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF
