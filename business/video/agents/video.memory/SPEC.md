## Responsibility

Episodic + long-term project memory; retrieval for any agent

## Knowledge distillation sources

Reflexion (Shinn 2023); MemGPT; vector-DB best practices

## Self-quality criteria

Retrieval precision@5 ≥0.9; freshness SLA

## Surpass-human signal

Higher recall than producer's bible at scale

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** All agents (correction events)

- **Comments on:** All agents (stale facts)

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant vector DB; MemGPT-style hierarchical memory; embedding models

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Reflexion memory architecture (MemGPT extension)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

and technical details. Based on this analysis, design and implement a complete backend server architecture that fulfills 
all outlined requirements. The backend server must be created within a dedicated 'backend' folder structure. Ensure the 
implementation includes proper API endpoints, database schema design, authentication mechanisms, error handling, logging 
systems, and follows RESTful principles. Document all API endpoints with clear specifications, implement comprehensive 
unit and integration tests, and verify that the server handles all edge cases and scalability requirements mentioned in 
task.md.
THEN:
Configure the application to integrate with GROK from x.ai by utilizing the environment variables defined in backend/.env  . 
Update all relevant codebase components to establish GROK as the primary Large Language Model (LLM) provider. This includes 
modifying API connection configurations, authentication parameters, model endpoints, and any existing LLM integration code 
to ensure seamless communication with GROK services. Implement proper error handling, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms.
Verify the integration by testing all LLM-dependent features including text generation, chat completions, and any custom 
model interactions. Document the configuration changes and ensure backward compatibility where applicable.

# How to create frontend services
Conduct comprehensive research and analysis of the task.md requirements document to architect and implement a complete 
frontend application with integrated backend services and knowledge-base functionality. Design and develop the frontend 
solution with the following specifications: analyze all functional requirements from task.md, create responsive UI 
components with modern frameworks, implement state management for complex data flows, establish API integrations with 
backend services, incorporate knowledge-base search and retrieval features, optimize performance for fast load times, 
implement accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1), create intuitive navigation patterns, add comprehensive error handling and 
user feedback mechanisms, ensure cross-browser compatibility, implement proper security measures for data handling, write 
unit and integration tests for all components, document the codebase with clear comments and README files, and save the 
complete frontend project structure to the designated frontend folder. The final deliverable must provide exceptional user 
experience through thoughtful interaction design, consistent visual hierarchy, smooth animations, mobile-first responsive 
design, and intuitive user workflows that minimize cognitive load while maximizing task completion efficiency.

```
**Task Owner:** Coding Agent  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 10–14 days (MVP core in 6 days; full scale, hybrid integration, wiki compounding, observability & benchmarks in remaining days)  
**Goal:** Deliver a **complete, production-ready, observable, evaluable, extensible, and benchmarked Agentic RAG system** that **precisely** implements the **4 Core Agentic Design Patterns** and **7 Architectural Elements** from the survey paper "Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey on Agentic RAG" (arXiv:2501.09136, v4 as of April 2026) and the YouTube video "Agentic RAG Overview: 4 Core Principles and 7 Architectural Elements!" (https://youtu.be/MT3DM82PRLc).

The system **must**:
- Natively ingest and index your **~65,000 Markdown files (~500 MB corpus)** using **hierarchical chunking** with memory-safe, incremental, resumable processing.
- Support **hybrid knowledge representation**: Chroma vector store + **LightRAG** (latest 2026 version with OpenSearch backend support) for entity-relation graph and dual-level retrieval.
- Include **persistent knowledge compounding** via optional Karpathy-style LLM Wiki output (`wiki_output/` vault with `index.md`, `log.md`, concepts/, frontmatter, [[links]]`).
- Be fully local-first, Dockerized, traceable (LangSmith), and production-hardened.

This specification is the **definitive, deeply-rethought synthesis** of the entire conversation history after 10+ iterations of refinement: original Agentic RAG request → Karpathy Wiki comparison table → LightRAG enhancement → scale for 65k MD → repeated calls for deeper design details.

## 1. Core Concepts from Paper (Exact Mapping – Non-Negotiable)

**4 Core Agentic Design Patterns** (must be visible as explicit graph cycles/conditional edges):
1. **Reflection** — Agents self-evaluate outputs (relevance, faithfulness, hallucination) using rubrics and iterate (Self-RAG style reflection tokens or grader loops).
2. **Planning** — Autonomous decomposition of complex queries into sub-tasks or multi-hop plans.
3. **Tool Use** — Dynamic, interleaved tool calling (ReAct-style: think → act → observe).
4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — Specialized agents with shared state, hierarchical supervision, or flat peer coordination.

**7 Architectural Elements** (explicitly realized in design):
1. Single-agent routing + multi-agent delegation.
2. Hierarchical / graph-based control flow (LangGraph Pregel execution).
3. Adaptive retrieval (query complexity → strategy selection).
4. Stateful memory (conversation + long-term index + checkpoints).
5. Hybrid knowledge (vector + lightweight KG + persistent Markdown).
6. Iterative refinement with quality gates and max iterations.
7. Evaluation-aware (built-in metrics, tracing, health checks).

**Key Differentiators** (include updated comparison table in README.md):
- Superior to naive RAG (adds agency).
- Superior to pure Karpathy Wiki (query-time agentic reasoning + optional write-back).
- LightRAG adds fast relational power without heavy GraphRAG rebuild costs.

## 3. Detailed Data Models (Pydantic v2 – Required)

Create `src/graph/state.py`:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Annotated, Literal
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langchain_core.documents import Document

class RetrievedDoc(BaseModel):
    doc: Document
    relevance_score: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    source: str
    chunk_type: Literal["parent", "child"]
    headers: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    lightrag_entities: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    lightrag_relations: List[Dict] = Field(default_factory=list)

class AgentState(BaseModel):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    query: str
    plan: Optional[List[str]] = None
    retrieved_docs: List[RetrievedDoc] = Field(default_factory=list)
    critique: Optional[str] = None
    confidence: float = Field(default=0.0, ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    iterations: int = Field(default=0, ge=0, le=3)
    final_answer: Optional[str] = None
    citations: List[Dict[str, str]] = Field(default_factory=list)
    wiki_output_path: Optional[str] = None
    lightrag_context: Optional[Dict] = None
    metadata: Dict = Field(default_factory=dict)  # tracing, timestamps, etc.
```

Use `checkpointer = MemorySaver()` (or AsyncSqliteSaver for production persistence).

## 4. Per-Node Detailed Design (Contracts, Inputs/Outputs, Prompts)

All nodes in `src/agents/`; each takes `state: AgentState` and returns `partial dict` for state update.

1. **query_analyzer**: Classify complexity (simple/factual vs. multi-hop/relational). Decide routing. Prompt: `prompts/analyzer.md` (rubric-based classification).

2. **planner**: Output numbered plan or sub-queries. Few-shot examples for multi-hop (e.g., "Compare X and Y" → sub-queries on each + synthesis).

3. **tool_router**: Structured output (Pydantic model) selecting tools + parameters. Support parallel tool calls where safe.

4. **researcher_grader**: 
   - Execute selected retrievers (vector + optional LightRAG).
   - Grade each doc with detailed rubric (relevance, completeness, recency, authority).
   - Filter (threshold 0.75) and reflect if collection is weak.
   - Conditional edge for reflection loop.

5. **generator**: Use filtered docs, plan, and critique to produce grounded answer with inline citations.

6. **critic**: Independent scoring (faithfulness 0–1 using RAGAS-style or custom LLM judge). Trigger loop if low.

7. **wiki_synthesizer**: Generate Obsidian-compatible Markdown (YAML frontmatter: `source`, `date`, `tags`, `confidence`; explicit [[WikiLinks]]; update `index.md` and `log.md`).

**Prompt Library** (`src/prompts/`): One `.md` file per node with:
- Strict system role + task.
- Detailed rubric or output format (JSON mode preferred).
- 2–4 few-shot examples (positive + negative).
- Chain-of-thought encouragement for reflection/planning.

## 5. Hybrid Retrieval & Indexing Design (65k MD Scale – Critical)

**Ingestion Pipeline** (`src/ingestion/pipeline.py` – memory-safe, incremental):

- **Loader**: `DirectoryLoader` with `**/*.md`, multiprocessing.Pool (16–32 workers, batch size 2000–5000 files).
- **Hierarchical Chunking** (2026 best practice for Markdown):
  1. `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` (header levels 1–4) → parent chunks (~2000–4000 tokens) with full header path in metadata.
  2. `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400–512, chunk_overlap=50–100)` on parent content → child chunks.
  3. Link via `parent_id` UUID.
- **Vector Indexing**: Chroma.from_documents (separate collections or metadata flag for parent/child). Use MMR retrieval.
- **LightRAG Indexing**: After vector, `lightrag.insert_batch(parent_chunks)` (async, entity/relation extraction). Use OpenSearch backend for scale (Docker compose included). Support incremental via hash/timestamp check.
- **Resumability**: JSON checkpoint with processed file hashes. GC after each batch.
- **Target Performance**: <45 min full ingestion on 32 GB RAM machine; incremental <1 min for small changes.

**Retrieval Logic**:
- Vector: `k=15`, `fetch_k=50`, reranker (optional Cohere or cross-encoder).
- LightRAG: `mode="hybrid"` (low-level entities + high-level relations).
- Adaptive: Router prefers LightRAG for queries with "compare", "how", "relation", "who connected to".

## 6. Tools (Dynamic & Extensible)

- `hybrid_retrieve(query: str, use_lightrag: bool = True)`
- `web_search_tavily`
- `wiki_writer(markdown_content: str, title: str)`
- Calculator, arXiv fetcher (bonus).

## 7. Graph Construction (`src/graph/agentic_rag_graph.py`)

- `StateGraph(AgentState)`
- Add nodes + conditional edges for reflection (`should_continue_reflection` based on confidence/iterations).
- Parallel tool execution where possible.
- Full LangSmith tracing on every node (callbacks).

## 8. UI, CLI, Evaluation & Production Features

- **Streamlit** (`app.py`): Chat interface + expandable reasoning trace (node-by-node with scores, docs, critiques) + "Save to Wiki" button.
- **Typer CLI** (`cli.py`): `ingest --resume`, `query "..." [--hybrid] [--wiki] [--trace]`, `lint-corpus`, `eval`, `build-wiki`.
- **Evaluation Harness** (`src/evaluation/`): RAGAS (faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_precision) + custom reflection score. 50+ golden query test set. Automated runs with JSON reports.
- **Observability**: LangSmith project per run; custom metadata for agentic metrics.
- **Docker**: Multi-container compose (app + Chroma + LightRAG OpenSearch + optional PostgreSQL).
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks, retry logic, rate limiting.

## 9. Phased Implementation Plan (Strict Order – With Checkpoints)

**Phase 0**: Project skeleton, requirements.txt, config, data models, prompts templates, Docker compose.  
**Phase 1**: Ingestion pipeline – full 65k MD benchmark + incremental mode + LightRAG indexing.  
**Phase 2**: Hybrid retriever + tools implementation.  
**Phase 3**: LangGraph core (state, nodes, edges, reflection/planning loops, memory).  
**Phase 4**: Multi-agent collaboration + critic + wiki synthesizer.  
**Phase 5**: Streamlit UI + CLI + tracing visualization + evaluation harness.  
**Phase 6**: Docker, tests, logging, security (API keys), README (diagrams, comparison table, benchmarks).  
**Phase 7**: End-to-end stress testing (100 complex queries), latency/quality benchmarks, final polish.

## 10. Success Criteria (Measurable & Verifiable)

1. Full 65k MD corpus ingested incrementally without OOM or crashes; benchmark logged.
2. Every complex query trace demonstrates **all 4 patterns** and **7 elements** visibly.
3. Reflection loop triggers on ≥30% of queries and measurably improves confidence/quality.
4. LightRAG hybrid mode shows superior performance on relational/multi-hop queries vs. pure vector.
5. Wiki synthesis produces clean, Obsidian-ready vault with proper frontmatter and links.
6. Evaluation: faithfulness ≥0.92, answer relevancy ≥0.90, average latency <4s on consumer hardware.
7. Code is clean, fully typed (Pydantic + mypy), documented, git-committed per phase.

# Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

## 1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

### 1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

### 1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

### 1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

### 1.4 Cognitive Architecture Enhancements from Ranked Human Thinking Models (v3 Addition)

To further strengthen the loop against the failure modes detailed in Section 1.5, v3 explicitly incorporates high-adoption-priority traditional human thinking models (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops in the companion `thinking_model.md` — full table of 40 models with phases, similarities, strengths, and scores). These are mapped as first-class mechanisms rather than afterthoughts, delivering **adaptive intelligence** (context-aware routing), **proactive robustness** (pre-action risk), **efficient cognition** (fast/slow paths), and **deeper organizational learning** (double-loop + structured reflection). Prioritized models (scores 9–10) receive the deepest integration; others enhance specific sub-components (verifier, ideation, harmonization).

**Key Mappings & Operationalization in the v3 Loop**:

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliability. |
| **Premortem Analysis** (2 / 10) | Phase 0 (after plan gen, before state commit) | Mandatory "assume spectacular failure in 6-12 months → work backward to identify top causes/risks → explicitly mitigate in living spec, success criteria, todo items, or agent roles." Can be run by orchestrator LLM or dedicated Red Team critic. | Directly strengthens Phase 0 planning with proactive risk simulation & critic; near-zero cost. |
| **After-Action Review (AAR)** (3 / 10) | Phase 4 (every milestone reflection or termination) | Structured 4-question template: (1) What was supposed to happen? (vs original spec/plan) (2) What actually happened? (from tracer/obs) (3) Why? (diagnosis) (4) What next? (lessons → concrete evolution actions). Feeds self-evolution. | Perfect upgrade for Phase 4 reflection + self-evolution; highly practical structured learning. |
| **Double-Loop Learning** (4 / 9.5) | Phase 4 (after AAR single-loop fixes) | After tactical fixes, explicitly ask: "What governing variables/assumptions (prompt templates, success criteria definitions, agent role boundaries, memory schemas, verification thresholds, or even the task decomposition strategy) led us here? Should they change at the meta level?" Only then commit versioned updates. | Core to making self-evolution truly powerful (double-loop) rather than symptom patching. |
| **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)** (5 / 9.5) + **Dual Process Theory (System 1 & 2)** (8 / 9) | Phase 1 (Thought/Decide step) + Memory layer | **Fast Recognition Path** (new): Before verbose ReAct, query Pattern Store (long-term memory of successful high-quality traces + outcome metadata + embeddings). If strong similarity match (and Cynefin context permits), perform lightweight mental simulation ("Similar to trace #47, expected good result with action Z") then act with minimal tokens. System 1 = fast/intuitive/RPD for routine/expert; System 2 = slow/deliberate full ReAct for novel/risky/uncertain. Metacognition (below) decides switch. Fallback to full loop on low confidence. | Enables high-value "Fast Recognition Path" in v3 for expert domains/repeated tasks; foundation for adaptive fast/slow thinking. |
| **Metacognition Cycle** (7 / 9) | Parallel lightweight process alongside all Phase 1 iterations | Ongoing: Planning (align intent to spec) → Monitoring (bias detection, context fit via Cynefin, progress vs todo/success criteria, confidence drift) → Evaluating (quick rigor pulse) → Adjust (trigger mode switch, early replan, or gate escalation in real time or at next decision). | Direct parallel to state management; easy to implement as lightweight meta-prompt or separate small LLM call. |
| **5 Whys + Ishikawa Fishbone + Fault Tree** (6 / 9) | Phase 4 (AAR "Why?" diagnosis) + Verifier/Critic issue analysis | On persistent failures or low-confidence observations: Drill with iterative 5 Whys; categorize root causes via Fishbone (People/Prompts, Process/Methods, Models/Tools, Data/Material, Environment/Context, Metrics) or simple fault tree. Results drive Double-Loop changes and spec hardening. | Greatly strengthens Thought + Reflection for complex problems; systematic visual + deep cause analysis. |
| **Red Team Thinking** (12 / 8) | Verifier / Phase 3 quality gates + Premortem | Dedicated critic mode or separate lightweight agent: "Adversarially attack this plan/draft/output to surface hidden weaknesses, edge cases, or single points of failure." Complements standard verifier schema. | Strong built-in devil’s advocate; easy to implement as dedicated critic agent role. |
| **Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework** (9 / 8.5) | Verifier prompt + Thought step augmentation | Enhance `verify_output` and decision prompts with Elements of Thought (purpose, question at issue, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, implications, point of view) + Intellectual Standards checklist (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness, sufficiency). | Excellent for enhancing Thought and Verifier quality; strong bias and rigor detection. |
| **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** (10 / 8.5) + **TRIZ** (14 / 8) | Phase 3 (Harmonize/Consolidation) + conflict resolution in self-evolution | When sub-results conflict or goals contradict: Use TOC Evaporating Cloud to surface and resolve core conflicts; apply TRIZ contradiction principles for inventive solutions. Feeds versioned prompt/agent edits. | Powerful for resolving conflicting goals; synergizes extremely well with TRIZ and self-evolution. |
| **Six Thinking Hats** (13 / 8) + **SCAMPER / Osborn-Parnes CPS** (15/11) | Phase 3 consolidation or creative sub-agent ideation | Optional multi-perspective pass (White=facts/data, Red=intuition/feelings, Black=risks/critic, Yellow=benefits/opportunities, Green=creativity/alternatives, Blue=process/meta) or SCAMPER checklist (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) during synthesis or when sub-agent is creative-writing/design-oriented. | Reduces blind spots effectively; directly upgrades ideation and creative sub-agents. |

**Additional Implementation Details (v3)**:
- **Memory Architecture Upgrade**: Add "Pattern Store" (vector + metadata of successful/failed traces with outcome scores) to support RPD fast matching. Hierarchical memory now explicitly tags traces with Cynefin context type for better retrieval.
- **Verifier / Critic Enhancements**: `verify_output` function now accepts `critic_mode` (or runs ensemble): "standard" | "red_team" | "paul_elder" | "six_hats". Returns aggregated issues + suggestions. Can be parallelized for depth.
- **Configurability in Task Spec**: New fields e.g. `"cognitive_profile": {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "complex"}` or auto-detected.
- **Metacognition Implementation**: Lightweight parallel prompt or small dedicated LLM call every N steps or on confidence drop / context shift. Updates shared state flags (e.g., `current_mode: "fast" | "full"`, `bias_flags: [...]`).
- **Early Exit / Efficiency**: Cynefin + RPD + Metacognition together allow safe early termination or fast-pathing on well-understood sub-problems without sacrificing the rigorous gates on hard parts — directly mitigating token waste and infinite-loop risks.

These additions are **production-aware**: all new steps are bounded, versioned, logged via tracer, and can be toggled or depth-limited per task. They transform the agent from a capable ReAct/hierarchical engine (v2) into a more cognitively complete system that thinks about its own thinking, anticipates failure, learns at multiple levels, and adapts its deliberation style to context — while fully preserving every v2 mechanism, code example, and mitigation.

### 1.5 Known Problems, Failure Modes & Targeted Mitigations (Research-Backed)

Recent systematic studies (especially the **MASFT taxonomy** from analysis of 150+ traces across popular multi-agent frameworks) identify that **most failures stem from design/spec issues (~40%+)**, coordination breakdowns, and weak verification/termination — **not raw model intelligence**. Single-agent ReAct loops suffer overlapping issues plus context bloat and repetitive behavior. Below is a synthesized taxonomy of the most common, well-documented problems, with **actionable mitigations** mapped directly to the phases in this document.

### Major Problem Categories & Frequency/Significance
1. **Specification & Design Ambiguities (Largest Category)**
   - Disobeying or misinterpreting task spec, vague roles, missing success criteria or output contracts.
   - **Impact**: Agents go off-track early; errors compound downstream.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 0: Mandatory structured Task Specification with explicit success criteria, constraints, output schema, and quality thresholds. Use "living spec" that can be updated.
     - Add automated spec validation (critic or schema check) before loop starts.
     - Clear role definitions and information contracts between orchestrator and sub-agents.

2. **Infinite Loops, Repetitive Actions & Thrashing**
   - Agent repeats the same (or similar) actions without progress; common in ReAct from poor exception handling or missing info; can be induced by prompt injection.
   - **Impact**: Wasted tokens/cost, timeouts, frustration (frequent real-world complaint).
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 1 loop: Add **cycle detection** (state hashing of recent actions + observations; if similarity > threshold, force replan or terminate).
     - Explicit `max_steps`, `max_reflection_rounds`, and progress-based early exit (e.g., todo completion %).
     - Bounded reflection: Limit "improve this" iterations.
     - `Done` / `Finish` tool with mandatory verification before acceptance.
     - In hierarchical: Orchestrator monitors sub-agent progress and can kill/reassign stuck branches.

3. **Context Window Explosion / Context Rot / History Bloat**
   - Long trajectories cause key early info or instructions to be dropped; leads to inconsistency, repetition, goal drift.
   - **Impact**: Degraded performance in long-running or multi-turn tasks.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Aggressive hierarchical memory: Short-term working memory + long-term persistent store (vector search, semantic caching, MemGPT-style).
     - Summarization at milestones or when context > threshold (signal-aware truncation).
     - Structured state (`task.md`, todo list, key facts only) instead of dumping full history every turn.
     - Sub-agents receive only relevant context slices + provenance.

4. **Hallucinations, Error Compounding & Verification Weakness**
   - Fabricated facts, incorrect tool results interpretation, or unverified claims propagating (worse in multi-agent).
   - **Impact**: Unreliable final outputs; cascading failures.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - **Verifier / Critic agents** as mandatory quality gates (Phase 3 consolidation and after sub-results).
     - Structured observation schema (status, confidence, issues list) + cross-validation (compare across agents/sources).
     - Multi-form verification (factual grounding in observations + external checks).
     - Trajectory ranking (e.g., Prospector-style critic selects best among multiple attempts).
     - In self-evolution: Only commit changes validated on held-out traces.

5. **Inter-Agent Misalignment & Coordination Failures (Multi-Agent Specific)**
   - Role overstepping, conflicting goals, stale state sharing, communication gaps, error propagation between agents.
   - **Impact**: Poor collaboration; sometimes single strong agent outperforms complex MAS.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Strong central **Orchestrator/Planner** with explicit decomposition and routing (hierarchical control beats flat).
     - Information contracts + structured handoff formats.
     - Versioned shared state + durable coordination primitives (e.g., streams, pub/sub).
     - Circuit breakers: Detect inconsistency → pause, reconcile, or escalate.
     - Clear "Extreme hierarchical differentiation" (well-defined specialist roles).

6. **Termination & Goal Drift Problems**
   - Premature stopping (incomplete work) or failure to recognize completion; agents continue or give up wrongly.
   - **Impact**: Wrong or partial results.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Explicit success criteria in spec + progress tracking against them.
     - Dedicated termination action (`Done` tool) that must pass verifier.
     - Periodic alignment checks in Thought step vs original objective.
     - Early termination signals when intermediate results satisfy criteria.

7. **Other Notable Issues**
   - **State staleness & memory failures**: Use hybrid memory (fast short-term + persistent long-term with retrieval).
   - **Security (prompt injection → loops or misuse)**: Sandbox tools, input sanitization, least-privilege tool access, monitoring for anomalous loops.
   - **Cost & scalability overhead**: Multi-agent only when benefit > coordination cost; monitor token usage per phase; parallel where safe.
   - **Debuggability**: Full tracer + structured logs are non-negotiable.

### How Mitigations Integrate into the Loop Phases
- **Phase 0 (Init)**: Spec engineering + validation is the single highest-ROI fix.
- **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**: Cycle detection, bounded steps/reflection, structured observations, progress tracking.
- **Phase 2 (Delegation)**: Narrow sub-specs + contracts; orchestrator monitoring.
- **Phase 3 (Consolidation)**: Verifier/critic gates, cross-validation, harmonization.
- **Phase 4 (Reflection/Self-evolution)**: Validation before applying changes; bounded loops.
- **Phase 5 (Termination)**: Verifier + explicit Done with evidence.

**Key Insight from Research**: Fixing **specification quality + verification layers + explicit termination controls** delivers the largest reliability gains. Adding more agents or raw model power without these often yields diminishing or negative returns.

## 2. The Complete Agent Loop Process (Actionable)

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. **v3 Cognitive Enhancements (Cynefin + Premortem)**:
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): LLM or lightweight classifier tags the task (Simple / Complicated / Complex / Chaotic) based on clarity of cause-effect, expert knowledge needed, emergence, or crisis nature. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop behavior (see 1.4 table): e.g., Simple/Complicated → prefer Fast Recognition Path + reduced reflection depth; Complex/Chaotic → enforce Full mode + AAR/Double-Loop + multi-critic ensemble.
   - **Premortem Analysis** (proactive risk critic): Before finalizing state, run dedicated step (orchestrator or Red Team critic): "Imagine this plan and spec have failed spectacularly after deployment. List the top 5-7 plausible causes. For each, propose concrete mitigations (update success_criteria, add todo risk items, tighten constraints, adjust agent roles, or add verification gates)." Merge mitigations into living spec and initial todo. This is now a recommended mandatory gate for all but the simplest tasks.
5. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid. Also set initial `cognitive_profile` flags from Cynefin + task type (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, etc.).

**Actionable Output Format** (example JSON or Markdown section):
```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "objective": "...",
  "success_criteria": ["...", "..."],
  "constraints": ["max_steps: 50", "budget_tokens: 200k"],
  "output_format": "structured report with citations",
  "initial_plan": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "quality_gates": ["completeness > 90%", "no hallucinations", "structured output"]
}
```

### Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
**v3 Mode Selection (Cynefin + RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition)**: At loop start or after major observation, determine operating mode:
- If Cynefin context is Simple/Complicated **and** high-similarity match found in Pattern Store (RPD) **and** metacognition confidence high → enter **Fast Recognition Path**: lightweight Thought (mental simulation only), skip verbose reasoning, proceed to action with minimal tokens. Log as "fast_path" for later AAR review.
- Otherwise (Complex/Chaotic, low pattern match, or explicit config) → **Full Deliberative Mode** (standard detailed ReAct Thought + full gates). Metacognition runs lightweight parallel monitor (bias scan, progress pulse, context drift check) and can force mode switch mid-iteration if uncertainty spikes.

1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager. Also retrieve relevant Pattern Store entries for RPD matching.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - **Metacognitive overlay** (parallel): "Am I in the right mode? Any detected biases (per Paul-Elder)? Progress vs success criteria and todo? Context still matches Cynefin tag? Any governing assumptions to flag for Double-Loop later?"
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish. (In Fast mode: keep this extremely concise.)
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "issues": ["list of problems"],
       "next_suggestions": ["..."],
       "trace_id": "..."
     }
     ```
   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

**Circuit Breaker Pattern (Recommended for Production)**

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures when a tool, LLM call, or sub-agent is repeatedly failing. They have three states:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests go through.
- **OPEN**: Too many failures → fast-fail immediately (protects the system).
- **HALF_OPEN**: After timeout, allow limited test requests to check recovery.

Use one circuit breaker per tool type or per sub-agent role. Integrate with the retry wrappers below.

**Termination Conditions** (checked every iteration or at gates):
- Success criteria met + quality gate passed.
- Max steps / token budget / time reached.
- Explicit `Done` / `Finish` action with validated output.
- Irrecoverable failure (escalate to human or higher orchestrator).
- Early exit if intermediate result satisfies objective.

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Delegation & Sub-Loops
When orchestrator decides to delegate:
1. **Decompose & Route**:
   - Planner selects or instantiates appropriate sub-agent type (specialist role, toolset, prompt template).
   - Creates narrow sub-task spec (subset of parent objective + relevant context slice).
   - Invokes sub-agent (can be same LLM with different system prompt/role, or different model).
2. **Sub-Agent Runs Independent Loop**:
   - Sub-agent executes its own ReAct-style iterations (or optimized variant) against its sub-spec.
   - Maintains local state/memory.
   - Can further delegate (tree) or call tools.
3. **Return Structured Result** to parent (bubbles up):
   - Same structured observation format above.
   - Includes provenance (which sub-agent, trace summary).
4. **Parent Handles**:
   - Records in global state/tracer.
   - Validates/integrates (merge with other branches, resolve conflicts via harmonization step).
   - Updates global plan/todo.
   - Decides next: more delegation, direct action, consolidate, or critique.

**Parallelism**: Where dependencies allow (e.g., independent research branches), run multiple sub-agents/tools concurrently (xAI multi-agent style or worktree isolation like Grok Build).

### Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

"You are a synthesis expert. Given the original task spec, current plan, and these sub-results [structured list], produce: 1) Updated progress summary. 2) Any conflicts resolved. 3) Draft final output section. 4) Remaining gaps and recommended next actions."

### Phase 4: Reflection, Critique & Self-Evolution (Advanced)
**v3 Structured Reflection (AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys / Ishikawa + Paul-Elder / Red Team)**: All reflections now follow an explicit, multi-layered protocol (configurable via task_spec.reflection_style). This upgrades the original verbal self-critique into a rigorous, multi-model cognitive process.

- **Mandatory AAR Template** (applied at every milestone, failure, or termination; directly from After-Action Review best practice):
  1. **What was supposed to happen?** — Re-state relevant parts of original task_spec, success criteria, plan, and expected observations.
  2. **What actually happened?** — Summarize from tracer + structured observations (successes, partials, errors, key metrics). Include Fast vs Full mode usage stats if applicable.
  3. **Why? (Diagnosis)** — 
     - First pass: Standard attribution (TextGrad-style or LLM).
     - Deep pass (if issues or Cynefin=Complex): Apply **5 Whys** iteratively on top 2-3 problems. Then categorize using **Ishikawa Fishbone** (or lightweight fault tree): e.g., Prompts/Methods, Models/Tools/Agents, Data/Observations, Context/Environment, State/Memory, Verification Gates, Human Spec.
     - Cross-check with **Paul-Elder** lens: Which elements of thought were weak? Which intellectual standards violated (accuracy? depth? fairness?)?
  4. **What next? (Actionable Lessons)** — Concrete, versionable changes. Prioritize by impact/effort.

- **Double-Loop Learning Layer** (always after AAR single-loop diagnosis, before committing changes):
  - "Beyond fixing the immediate symptoms: What *governing variables* or foundational assumptions created the conditions for this outcome? Examples: Was our definition of 'quality output' too loose? Did agent role boundaries allow drift? Is the memory retrieval strategy misaligned with task type? Should success criteria themselves evolve? Should we add new critic roles or change loop routing logic?"
  - Only changes that survive this meta-question are proposed for validation + registration. This prevents superficial patching and enables genuine architectural self-improvement.

- **Per-trajectory or milestone reflection** (original): LLM summarizes trace, diagnoses failures/successes, proposes improvements (prompt edits, tool patches, new sub-agent types). Now wrapped inside the AAR + Double-Loop structure above.

- **Self-evolution loop** (inspired by AgentOrchestra, enhanced):
  1. Collect trace via tracer + AAR output.
  2. Attribute errors / opportunities (LLM or TextGrad-style) **within AAR/Double-Loop frame**.
  3. Propose targeted changes (to prompts, tools, agent configs, success criteria, or even generated code / memory schemas).
  4. Validate changes (re-execute on held-out or similar task; check metrics; optionally re-run Premortem on proposed new version).
  5. If improved (and Double-Loop approved): Register new version (with lineage + AAR justification). Support rollback. Update Pattern Store with outcome metadata for future RPD use.
  6. Optional: If change is meta (e.g., new critic mode or routing rule), propagate to cognitive_profile defaults.

- **Critic Agent Role** (enhanced): Separate lightweight agent that reviews drafts/plans without full execution. Can be invoked at gates. Now supports multiple modes (standard | red_team | paul_elder | six_hats | ensemble) as defined in Section 1.4. Red Team mode is especially recommended during Premortem and high-stakes consolidation.

- **Benefits**: Continuous improvement during runtime; production systems become more robust over repeated use on similar task distributions. The combination of AAR structure, Double-Loop depth, systematic root-cause (5 Whys/Fishbone), and multi-perspective critics (Paul-Elder/Red Team) makes Phase 4 a true engine for compounding intelligence rather than just incremental fixes. Fast-path traces are still reviewed (lighter AAR) so the system can learn when to trust RPD matches.

**Implementation Tip**: Store AAR outputs as structured artifacts linked to versions in the registry. This creates an auditable "learning history" that future agents (or the same system on similar tasks) can retrieve for RPD-style pattern matching.

### Phase 5: Termination & Output
- When gates passed or termination condition met:
  1. Final synthesis pass.
  2. Structured final output (match spec).
  3. Optional: Post-hoc reflection summary for user or logging.
  4. Persist full trace + versions for audit/replay/debug.
- **Human-in-loop hooks**: At quality gate failures, high-stakes actions, or budget exhaustion.

## 3. State, Memory & Infrastructure Recommendations

- **State Schema**: task_spec + current_plan/todo + history (thought/action/observation tuples) + memory (key-value or vector) + versions + tracer.
- **Memory Management**: Hierarchical (local per sub-agent + global). Summarization on context pressure. Session-isolated for concurrency.
- **Tracing**: Full execution graph (who called what, results, timings, versions). Enables debugging, reflection, and optimization.
- **Versioning** (TEA-inspired): Prompts, tools, agent roles, generated artifacts — all versioned with semantic lineage and rollback.
- **xAI Integration Tips**:
  - Use Grok multi-agent mode for research-heavy top-level tasks.
  - Mix server-side agentic tools with client-side custom tools (hybrid).
  - For coding agents: Adopt plan-first + parallel sub-agents in isolated environments (worktrees).
  - Stream reasoning tokens when possible for transparency.
- **Production Hardening**:
  - Strict output schemas (JSON mode or constrained decoding).
  - Timeouts, retry with backoff, circuit breakers on failing tools/sub-agents.
  - Cost/token budgets + monitoring.
  - Logging + observability (every thought/action/observation).
  - Sandboxed execution for tools/code.

## 4. Decision Framework (When to Use What)

| Task Complexity       | Recommended Pattern                  | Key Features to Enable          | Example Use Case |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Simple fact lookup    | Flat ReAct (single loop)            | Tool calling, basic thought    | Quick search + answer |
| Multi-step research   | xAI Multi-Agent or Hierarchical     | Parallel agents, leader synth  | Deep analysis with sources |
| Coding / long project | Plan-first + Hierarchical + Worktrees | Sub-agents in isolation, todo.md | Full app generation + debug |
| Open-ended / creative | ReAct + Reflection + Self-evolution | Critic gates, versioned prompts| Iterative design refinement |
| High-stakes / reliable| All above + strong Quality Gates    | Structured results, validation | Enterprise automation |

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations (from Research)

**Primary reference: See the full MASFT-style taxonomy, failure modes, and phase-specific mitigations in Section 1.5 above.** The points below are retained for quick scanning and now include additional patterns from recent studies.

- **Context explosion**: Aggressive summarization + hierarchical state (local sub-memories).
- **Infinite loops / thrashing**: Hard max iterations + progress tracking in todo + critic that can force replan or escalate.
- **Poor consolidation**: Mandate structured sub-results + dedicated harmonization/reporter step.
- **Hallucinations in plans**: Ground every major claim in observations; use critic before committing to plan.
- **Brittle delegation**: Use explicit sub-task specs + success criteria; validate returned results.
- **Lack of visibility**: Full tracing + optional streaming of reasoning.

## 6. Quick-Start Pseudocode Skeleton (Python-like)

```python
def agent_loop(task_instruction, tools, sub_agent_registry, max_steps=50):
    state = initialize_state(task_instruction)  # spec, plan, todo, memory, tracer
    orchestrator = get_llm(role="orchestrator")
    
    while not should_terminate(state, max_steps):
        # 1. Observe
        context = build_context(state)
        
        # 2. Reason + Decide
        decision = orchestrator.generate(
            prompt=build_decision_prompt(context, state.spec),
            output_schema=DECISION_SCHEMA  # thought, action_type, payload
        )
        
        if decision.action_type == "tool":
            obs = execute_tool(decision.payload, tools)
        elif decision.action_type == "delegate":
            sub_result = invoke_sub_agent(decision.payload, sub_agent_registry)  # runs its own loop
            obs = structured_observation_from(sub_result)
        elif decision.action_type == "synthesize":
            obs = consolidate_and_gate(state)
        elif decision.action_type == "finish":
            return finalize_output(state, decision)
        
        # 3. Update state
        state.history.append(decision.thought, decision, obs)
        state = update_todo_and_plan(state, obs)
        
        # 4. Optional light reflection or full self-evolution pass
        if should_reflect(state):
            state = reflect_and_evolve(state)  # critique + version updates
    
    return handle_termination(state)
```

Sub-agent invoke follows the same pattern recursively (narrower scope).

# Knowledge Router Agent — Complete Specification & Implementation Guide
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-06-06  
**Status:** Production-Ready Spec (Rethought across research papers, best practices, and your specific use cases)  
**Domains:** AI Filmmaking (text-to-video, consistency, cinematic pipelines) + AI Agents (multi-agent orchestration, advanced RAG, self-improving systems)  
**Philosophy:** Spec-driven, critic-loop heavy, hybrid deterministic + learned routing, fully traceable, continuously improving.

---

## Executive Summary

The **Knowledge Router Agent** is the central intelligence layer that ensures every specialized agent in your system (Character Consistency Critic, Video Prompt Optimizer, Multi-Agent Orchestrator Designer, Shot Planning Agent, etc.) receives **precisely the right knowledge** from your growing ~5,000-file `.md` corpus — with minimal noise, high precision, and strong explainability.

It draws from 2025–2026 research (AgentRouter’s graph-guided GNN routing with performance supervision, RopMura/RIRS centroid-based + iterative planning, Self-RAG reflection tokens, CRAG corrective retrieval, MasRouter unified routing, and production patterns from xAI Grok multi-agent modes) while being fully generalized for any knowledge-intensive domain.

**Core Innovations in This Design**
- **Hybrid Routing Stack** (Metadata-first → Cluster/Centroid semantic → Graph traversal → LLM ranker with reflection)
- **Dual Planner + Router** for complex multi-hop creative/technical pipelines
- **Built-in Multi-Level Critic** (retrieval quality, routing decision, downstream utility) inspired by Self-RAG
- **Performance-Supervised Improvement** (soft labels from actual agent success, like AgentRouter)
- **Traceable + Explainable** by design
- **Training-free bootstrap** (RopMura style) with optional learned components
- **Domain packs** for your key agents (Character Consistency, Prompt Engineering for Video, Agentic Video Production, etc.)

This spec is ready for direct implementation or feeding into your N1ch01as Architect coding agents.

## 1. Purpose & Success Criteria

**Purpose**  
Serve as the single, intelligent gateway between any requesting agent and the curated knowledge base. It must understand *who* is asking, *what* they need, and *why*, then deliver the optimal context pack with full reasoning.

**Success Criteria (Quality Gates)**
- Retrieval precision (relevant files returned in top results): ≥ 88% (critic or human eval)
- Routing decision quality (downstream agent success improvement): measurable lift
- Latency: < 4s p95 for standard queries; < 8s for complex pipeline queries
- Explainability: 100% of decisions produce human-readable + structured trace
- Continuous improvement: Routing accuracy improves over time via critic feedback and performance signals
- Cost efficiency: Avoids over-retrieval; supports cost-aware routing

```

**Key Design Principles**
- **Metadata First**: Hard constraints eliminate 70-80% of irrelevant files instantly.
- **Graph-Guided Intelligence**: Relationships between concepts (e.g., “character consistency techniques improve multi-shot narrative in Seedance”) enable smarter routing.
- **Iterative Refinement**: For complex queries (full AI video production pipeline), Planner + iterative evaluation/simplification (RopMura style).
- **Self-Reflection**: The Router itself uses reflection tokens / critic steps (Self-RAG inspired) to judge its own retrieval quality before finalizing output.
- **Generalized + Extensible**: Core logic is domain-agnostic; domain packs and agent_relevance tags make it powerful for your AI Filmmaking + AI Agents corpus.

## 4. Core Components (Detailed)

### 4.1 Query Analyzer + Intent Classifier
- Parses task_description + required_concepts + previous_failures.
- Extracts entities (tools: Seedance, Kling; concepts: character_consistency).
- Classifies complexity and whether Planner is needed.
- Uses lightweight reflection: “Is this query about a single technique or a full pipeline?”

### 4.2 Planner (for High-Complexity / Pipeline Queries)
Inspired by RopMura: When `routing_hints.complexity == "pipeline"` or `multi_hop_expected == true`:
- Decomposes into sub-tasks (e.g., 1. Character bible creation, 2. Shot-by-shot consistency rules, 3. Lighting-specific mitigations, 4. Tool-specific prompt patterns).
- Routes sub-tasks iteratively or in parallel.
- Uses Question Simplifier / Response Evaluator loop (max 4–5 rounds).

### 4.3 Hybrid Retrieval Engine (The Heart)
**Layered Approach (in order):**

1. **Metadata Hard Filters** (fast, deterministic, 70-80% reduction)
   - Exact match on `agent_relevance`, `category`, `tags` intersection, `quality_score`, recency, etc.

2. **Cluster / Centroid Semantic Retriever** (RopMura-inspired, efficient)
   - Pre-compute coherent clusters per major subcategory (consistency_systems, prompt_engineering_video, multi_agent_patterns, etc.).
   - Store only centroids + representative files.
   - Query embedding → Top-K centroids → expand to files in those clusters.
   - Great for scaling without broadcasting to entire 5k corpus.

3. **Graph Explorer** (AgentRouter-inspired)
   - Lightweight traversal or small heterogeneous GNN (if you train one later).
   - Nodes: techniques, tools (Seedance, Kling, LangGraph), failure_modes, papers, agent_roles.
   - Relations: improves, requires, common_failure_when, used_together_with, mitigates.
   - Example path: `character_consistency` → `improves` → `multi_shot_narrative` + `failure_mode:clothing_drift_under_dramatic_lighting`.

4. **LLM Ranker + Reflection** (Self-RAG / CRAG inspired)
   - Scores candidates on relevance to task + previous_failures + constraints.
   - Reflection step: “Are these passages actually useful for the downstream agent’s goal?” “Is anything critical missing?”
   - Can trigger corrective re-retrieval if quality low.

### 4.4 Context Assembler
- Options: raw top chunks | synthesized summary | structured knowledge pack (best for your critic-heavy agents).
- For creative agents: often returns “Knowledge Pack” with sections like Best Practices, Failure Modes & Mitigations, Tool-Specific Notes, Prompt Templates.

### 4.5 Explainer & Traceability
Every output includes a clear `reasoning_trace` (structured + natural language). This is non-negotiable for debugging and critic loops.

### 4.6 Multi-Level Critic (Self-Improving Core)
Three levels:
1. **Retrieval Critic**: Scores relevance, coverage of required_concepts, handling of previous_failures.
2. **Routing Critic**: Judges whether the right files were chosen vs alternatives; suggests better tags or graph edges.
3. **Downstream Utility Critic**: (Ideal) Observes or gets feedback from the requesting agent after it uses the context (“Did this knowledge help you succeed? What was missing?”). Feeds back as soft supervision signal (like AgentRouter’s F1-based training targets).

This turns the Router into a learning system over time.

---

## 5. Particular Use Case Implementations

### Use Case 1: Character Consistency Critic Agent
**Request Example**: See Input contract above (wuxia fight scene).

**Router Behavior**:
- Hard filter: `tags CONTAIN character_consistency AND multi_shot`
- Graph: Pulls “clothing_drift” failure mode nodes + mitigation techniques
- Returns structured pack: “Best reference sheet practices for Seedance + Kling”, “Lighting-induced color shift mitigations”, “Multi-shot coherence checklist”
- Critic checks coverage of “previous_failures”

### Use Case 2: Video Prompt Optimizer Agent
- Prioritizes files tagged `prompt_engineering`, `camera_movement_prompts`, `lighting_prompts`, `negative_prompts`, `seedance_prompt_formulas`, `2026_best_practices`
- Graph traversal for “prompt formula that worked with dynamic camera in cinematic scenes”
- Returns prompt templates + before/after examples + common failure prompts to avoid

### Use Case 3: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Designer
- Routes to `multi_agent_patterns`, `langgraph`, `crewai_roles`, `memory_architectures`, `production_ready_patterns`, `agentic_video_production`
- Planner decomposes: “Orchestration for consistency across shots” + “Cost/latency optimization for video gen agents”
- Returns role definitions, graph patterns, and real pipeline examples from your corpus

### Use Case 4: Shot Planning Agent (Script → Shot List → Generation)
- High complexity → activates Planner
- Iterative routing across scriptwriting, cinematography language, tool-specific shot capabilities, consistency constraints
- Final pack: Structured shot list template + per-shot prompting guidance + consistency guardrails

**Generalization Note**: For any new domain, simply:
- Add `agent_relevance` values in frontmatter
- Define new clusters / graph node types
- Optionally create a small “Domain Pack” template

---

## 6. Knowledge Base Integration Requirements

Every `.md` file **must** have rich frontmatter (this is non-negotiable for the Router to work well):

```yaml
---
title: "..."
category: ai_filmmaking | ai_agents | intersection_agentic_filmmaking
subcategory: consistency_systems | prompt_engineering_video | multi_agent_orchestration | ...
tags: [character_consistency, multi_shot, seedance, failure_modes, ...]
agent_relevance: [character_consistency_critic, video_prompt_optimizer, shot_planning_agent, ...]
domain: creative_video | agent_engineering | both
quality_score: 8.7          # human or critic rated
source_type: youtube | book | course | synthetic | research_paper
date_added: 2026-05-20
last_reviewed: 2026-06-01
---
```

**Recommended Additions for Scale**:
- Pre-computed cluster_id or centroid_id per file
- Graph node references (optional but powerful)

---

## 7. Phased Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (MVP – 7–14 days)**
- Metadata hard filters + basic vector search
- Simple Query Analyzer
- Basic Context Assembler + Explainer
- Manual / lightweight critic feedback loop
- Bootstrap with your existing top 500–1000 high-quality files

**Phase 2 (Production Core)**
- Add Cluster/Centroid layer (RopMura style)
- Lightweight Graph Explorer (traversal first, small GNN later)
- Planner for pipeline queries
- Structured Knowledge Pack output
- Automated Critic (levels 1–2)

**Phase 3 (Learning System)**
- Performance signal feedback loop (downstream agent success → soft labels)
- Optional small RouterGNN (AgentRouter style) trained on your data
- Proactive suggestions / push mode
- Full self-improvement via critic + usage analytics

**Phase 4 (Advanced)**
- Cost/latency-aware routing
- Multi-modal support (if you add image/video references to knowledge base)
- Integration with your full N1ch01as Architect harness + main Critic Agent

---

## 8. Evaluation Framework

- **Offline**: Golden test set of 50–100 representative queries per major agent role. Measure precision@K, recall of required_concepts, critic scores.
- **Online**: Track downstream agent success rate before/after Router improvements. Log critic scores and human spot-checks.
- **Ablation**: Test impact of each layer (metadata only vs +graph vs +reflection).
- **Continuous**: Router critic proposes improvements to the knowledge base itself (new tags, missing content detection).

---

## 9. Edge Cases & Mitigations

- **Very broad query** → Planner forces decomposition + strict max_files.
- **No good matches** → Router returns “Insufficient high-quality knowledge” + suggestions to expand corpus + low confidence flag.
- **Conflicting information** across files → Graph + Critic prioritize higher quality_score + more recent + explicit failure mode coverage.
- **New agent role appears** → Easy extension: add to `agent_relevance` tags; Router gradually learns via feedback.
- **Latency spikes on complex queries** → Planner has round limits; fallback to simpler retrieval.

---

## 10. Tech Recommendations (Aligned with Your Stack)

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph or your custom harness (excellent for stateful Planner + Router + Critic loops)
- **Vector + Metadata**: LlamaIndex or Haystack with Qdrant/Pinecone (strong metadata filtering)
- **Graph**: Lightweight NetworkX/Neo4j for traversal; optional small GNN later (PyG or DGL)
- **Embeddings**: High-quality model (e.g., voyage, Snowflake, or your preferred)
- **LLM for Analyzer/Ranker/Critic**: Mix of strong reasoning model (Grok 4, Claude 4, DeepSeek R1, etc.) + cheaper models for simple steps
- **Storage**: All `.md` files in git + vector DB + optional graph DB

---

## 11. Generalization to Any Domain

This design is deliberately **domain-agnostic at the core**:
- Replace `category` / `subcategory` / `agent_relevance` with your new domain’s taxonomy.
- Define new clusters and graph schemas.
- The Hybrid Retrieval + Planner + Multi-Level Critic pattern transfers directly.

Your AI Filmmaking + AI Agents corpus is actually an **excellent stress test** because it combines creative, technical, and meta-agent knowledge — success here means the Router will generalize extremely well.

---

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. Review and refine this spec with your main Critic Agent.
2. Start Phase 1 implementation (I can generate the detailed task.md + code skeletons next).
3. Audit/enrich frontmatter on your top 300–500 highest-value files.
4. Build the first version of the Metadata + Vector layer and test with 2–3 of your real agents.

**Acceptance rules:**
1. **Blocker** severity halts the DAG until resolved.
2. **Major** triggers a Self-Refine / Reflexion loop (max 3 iterations) on the receiving agent.
3. **Minor / nit** is logged to the agent's memory store and aggregated for the next training cycle (RLAIF reward signal).
4. Disputes between two agents go to a **JudgeAgent** running multi-agent debate (Du et al. 2023) with the relevant rubric as the constitution; if unresolved, escalates to a HumanInTheLoop reviewer.
5. Every accepted critique is appended to the artifact's C2PA provenance chain so downstream agents and humans can audit.



### From `corpus/study/agent_loop_v2.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/agent_loop_v2.md`.


**Version:** 2026-06-07 (Updated with comprehensive research on known agent loop failure modes from MASFT taxonomy & related studies, plus targeted mitigations from Reflexion, critic frameworks, structured specs, memory architectures, and production patterns)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, and developer reports on infinite loops/context issues.
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

3. **Context Window Explosion / Context Rot / History Bloat**
   - Long trajectories cause key early info or instructions to be dropped; leads to inconsistency, repetition, goal drift.
   - **Impact**: Degraded performance in long-running or multi-turn tasks.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Aggressive hierarchical memory: Short-term working memory + long-term persistent store (vector search, semantic caching, MemGPT-style).
     - Summarization at milestones or when context > threshold (signal-aware truncation).
     - Structured state (`task.md`, todo list, key facts only) instead of dumping full history every turn.
     - Sub-agents receive only relevant context slices + provenance.

7. **Other Notable Issues**
   - **State staleness & memory failures**: Use hybrid memory (fast short-term + persistent long-term with retrieval).
   - **Security (prompt injection → loops or misuse)**: Sandbox tools, input sanitization, least-privilege tool access, monitoring for anomalous loops.
   - **Cost & scalability overhead**: Multi-agent only when benefit > coordination cost; monitor token usage per phase; parallel where safe.
   - **Debuggability**: Full tracer + structured logs are non-negotiable.

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid.

### Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish.
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "issues": ["list of problems"],
       "next_suggestions": ["..."],
       "trace_id": "..."
     }
     ```
   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Delegation & Sub-Loops
When orchestrator decides to delegate:
1. **Decompose & Route**:
   - Planner selects or instantiates appropriate sub-agent type (specialist role, toolset, prompt template).
   - Creates narrow sub-task spec (subset of parent objective + relevant context slice).
   - Invokes sub-agent (can be same LLM with different system prompt/role, or different model).
2. **Sub-Agent Runs Independent Loop**:
   - Sub-agent executes its own ReAct-style iterations (or optimized variant) against its sub-spec.
   - Maintains local state/memory.
   - Can further delegate (tree) or call tools.
3. **Return Structured Result** to parent (bubbles up):
   - Same structured observation format above.
   - Includes provenance (which sub-agent, trace summary).
4. **Parent Handles**:
   - Records in global state/tracer.
   - Validates/integrates (merge with other branches, resolve conflicts via harmonization step).
   - Updates global plan/todo.
   - Decides next: more delegation, direct action, consolidate, or critique.

### Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

## 3. State, Memory & Infrastructure Recommendations

- **State Schema**: task_spec + current_plan/todo + history (thought/action/observation tuples) + memory (key-value or vector) + versions + tracer.
- **Memory Management**: Hierarchical (local per sub-agent + global). Summarization on context pressure. Session-isolated for concurrency.
- **Tracing**: Full execution graph (who called what, results, timings, versions). Enables debugging, reflection, and optimization.
- **Versioning** (TEA-inspired): Prompts, tools, agent roles, generated artifacts — all versioned with semantic lineage and rollback.
- **xAI Integration Tips**:
  - Use Grok multi-agent mode for research-heavy top-level tasks.
  - Mix server-side agentic tools with client-side custom tools (hybrid).
  - For coding agents: Adopt plan-first + parallel sub-agents in isolated environments (worktrees).
  - Stream reasoning tokens when possible for transparency.
- **Production Hardening**:
  - Strict output schemas (JSON mode or constrained decoding).
  - Timeouts, retry with backoff, circuit breakers on failing tools/sub-agents.
  - Cost/token budgets + monitoring.
  - Logging + observability (every thought/action/observation).
  - Sandboxed execution for tools/code.

```python
def agent_loop(task_instruction, tools, sub_agent_registry, max_steps=50):
    state = initialize_state(task_instruction)  # spec, plan, todo, memory, tracer
    orchestrator = get_llm(role="orchestrator")

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven)
1. Parse instruction → create **structured Task Specification** (objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, budgets, quality thresholds).
2. Initialize state: `task.md`, todo list, memory, tracer, version registry.
3. (Optional but recommended) Generate high-level plan and validate it.
4. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct vs Hierarchical.

### From `corpus/study/system_build_plan.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/system_build_plan.md`.


- `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — living checklist mirroring §6 milestones and §14 hardening; you tick items as you complete them.
- `DECISIONS.md` — an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log; every non-obvious choice gets a dated entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` (root + per-package) — your persistent project memory (template in Appendix A).
- `.claude/` — your subagents, slash commands, settings, and hooks (Appendices B–D).

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** (template in Appendix A): tech stack + pinned versions, monorepo map, the 7 Golden Rules (§0.3), build/test/lint commands, code-style rules, contract location, and "where to find the spec for X."
- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`**: each `packages/*` and `services/*` gets a short `CLAUDE.md` describing its responsibility, public API, and local test command. Nested files load when you work in that subtree, keeping context tight.
- **Keep it lean.** `CLAUDE.md` competes with task context. Link to specs rather than pasting them. Run `/memory` to review; prune aggressively.
- Bootstrap with `/init`, then hand-edit to match Appendix A.

| Concern | Choice | Rationale (from specs) |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Agent orchestration (DAG) | **LangGraph** | DAG + conditional edges + first-class HiTL gates + checkpointing. |
| Durable workflow engine | **Temporal (Python SDK)** | Productions run minutes→hours; guaranteed delivery, retries, replay. |
| Event bus | **Redis Streams** (dev/MVP) → **NATS JetStream** (scale) | Pub/sub + persistence + replay; topic-per-production. |
| Relational store | **PostgreSQL 16** + **SQLModel/SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic** | Production metadata, gate state, critiques, configs, audit log. (Spec mentions Drizzle; we standardize on Python ORM since the gateway is FastAPI. TS types are generated from Pydantic — see §5.6. ADR-001.) |
| Object storage | **S3 / Cloudflare R2** (via `boto3`/S3 API) | Video/audio/image artifacts; content-addressed keys. |
| Vector DB | **Chroma** (dev) → **Pinecone/Weaviate** (prod) | MemoryAgent + Agentic RAG retrieval. |
| Graph/Hybrid RAG | **LightRAG over OpenSearch** | Per [`agentic_rag_functional_specification.md`](./agentic_rag_functional_specification.md). |
| Cache / sessions / rate-limit | **Redis** | Hot data, locks, token buckets. |
| API gateway | **FastAPI** + **uvicorn/gunicorn** | REST + WebSocket gateway. |
| LLM access | **litellm** unified client | One interface for Grok-4.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 4, OSS. |
| Observability | **LangSmith** (agent traces) + **OpenTelemetry → Grafana/Tempo/Loki** | Traces, metrics, logs, replay. |
| Provenance | **C2PA** (`c2pa-python`) | Sign every artifact; verify chain downstream. |
| Containerization | **Docker** + **docker-compose** (dev) → **Kubernetes + Helm** (prod) | GPU node pool for gen tasks; CPU pool for LLM-only. |
| Secrets | **Doppler/Vault** (prod), `.env` + `direnv` (dev, gitignored) | Never in repo. |

```

**Acceptance rules (implement in `agent-core`, test exhaustively):**
- `blocker` → halts the DAG node until resolved (Temporal signal / LangGraph interrupt).
- `major` → triggers Self-Refine/Reflexion loop on the receiver, **max 3 iterations**, then escalate to JudgeAgent.
- `minor`/`nit` → logged to MemoryAgent; aggregated as RLAIF reward signal for the next training cycle.
- Two-agent disputes → routed to JudgeAgent (multi-agent debate). ComplianceAgent critiques are always `blocker` (BLOCK gate).

The base class wires in: LLM gateway (metered), RAG client, MemoryAgent, event-bus emit, provenance signing, OTel span. **No agent subclass reimplements these.** Specializations differ only by `AgentConfig`.

Topics (from `ui/architecture_communication.md`): `production.{id}.agent_events`, `.critiques`, `.gates`, `.artifacts`, plus `system.alerts`. Every event is one of the typed WebSocket event models (`agent_state_change`, `artifact_created`, `critique_message`, `gate_ready`, `gate_resolved`, `budget_update`, `metric_update`, `memory_entry`, `tool_call`, `production_phase_change`, `error`). These live in `packages/contracts/events.py` and are the *only* shapes allowed on the bus.

**Build:**
- `packages/eventbus`: typed Redis Streams pub/sub; topic contract (§5.7); replayable; at-least-once + idempotency keys.
- `packages/observability`: OTel tracing + structured logs + LangSmith hookup; every node run is a span.
- `services/orchestrator`:
  - **LangGraph graph runtime**: nodes = agent tasks; conditional edges; **HiTL interrupt** points (gates); checkpointer backed by Postgres.
  - **Temporal workflows/activities**: each agent task is a Temporal activity (retry/backoff/timeout); the production is a Temporal workflow (resumable across restarts).
  - **OrchestratorAgent / PlannerAgent / RouterAgent / JudgeAgent / GateKeeperAgent / MemoryAgent** skeletons (agents #53–58) — these are *platform* agents, built here, refined in M8.
  - DAG primitives: fan-out/fan-in, dependency-triggered rerender, deadlock detection, SLA timers.
- `packages/memory`: episodic + long-term project memory (Reflexion/MemGPT pattern) over the vector DB; `MemoryAgent` retrieval API.
- Asset/Data backbone: immutable `artifact_id`, copy-on-write versions, dependency edges, searchable metadata (Postgres + S3/MinIO), C2PA signing via `packages/provenance`.
- State store: production state machine; gate state; durable, auditable, resumable.

**Build:**
- **Orchestration (53–58):** harden Orchestrator/Planner/Router/Judge/GateKeeper/Memory with full dispute-resolution (multi-agent debate), stage-gate sign-off, and escaped-defect=0 discipline.
- **Creative (59–65):** Ideation, NarrativeArc, StyleTransfer, MoodBoard, Novelty/Anti-Cliché, EmotionalArc, WorldBuilding — many delegate to GCA/Aesthetics (no duplication).
- **Research (66–72):** Web/Archive/Trend/Competitor/Citation/InterviewSynthesis/Benchmark — built on the M4 Research Agent core.
- **Optimization (73–80):** Prompt/Cost/Latency/Retention/ROAS/Accessibility optimizers + EvaluationHarness + SafetyRedTeam.
- **Full QC mesh**: complete L3 (AudienceSim ≥200 personas + HiTL sampling) and Q1–Q6 delivery validators; `GateKeeperAgent` enforces "zero leaked defects."

**Build:**
- `services/api-gateway` (FastAPI): REST endpoints + WebSocket gateway exactly per the API contract tables in [`architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md) (`POST /api/productions`, gate decisions, critiques, retry/skip, router-config, artifacts, delivery). Auth/RBAC, rate-limit, validation, C2PA signing on gate approval. Subscribes to the Event Bus, filters by `production_id`, fans out over WebSocket.
- `apps/web` (Next.js 15 + React 19): Brief Studio, DAG Canvas (live node states), Artifact Gallery, Critique Feed, Gate Approval Dialog, Budget Tracker, Quality Dashboard, Agent Inspector, Memory Panel, Delivery Hub. State via Zustand + React Query; WebSocket via socket.io-client (auto-reconnect, room-per-production). Types imported from generated `packages/contracts/ts` (§5.6).
- Project-creation flow + production-scale discovery (S0–S? scale profiles) + video-remake/enhancement flow.

### Theme 1 — Contracts & Schema Integrity (1–10)
1. Every inter-agent message is a typed `packages/contracts` model; zero ad-hoc dicts on the bus.
2. Handoff `Artifact` populated at every phase boundary (no empty required fields).
3. Contract snapshot tests guard all models; removal/rename requires version bump + ADR.
4. Generated TS types are in sync with Pydantic (CI diff check green).
5. `parent_assets` always form an acyclic provenance DAG.
6. CritiqueMessage severity semantics enforced (blocker halts, major→3-iter refine, minor/nit→memory).
7. Event-bus payloads validate against `events.py`; invalid events are rejected, not silently dropped.
8. Versioning is copy-on-write; no in-place artifact mutation anywhere.
9. `qc_status` and `provenance_manifest` are never null on a releasable artifact.
10. No package redefines a shared contract locally (grep proves single source).

### Theme 3 — Agent Correctness (21–30)
21. All 114 agents instantiated via the factory (no bespoke loops).
22. Each agent passes L1 schema conformance on its golden inputs.
23. Each agent scores ≥85 on its L2 rubric (frozen judge).
24. Critique edges match the §4 matrix exactly (no missing/extra edges).
25. Tool allowlist enforced; an agent calling a disallowed tool fails closed.
26. Self-Refine caps at `max_refine_iters`; runaway loops impossible.
27. Reflexion memory writes/reads verified; lessons persist across retries.
28. No a

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA).  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces) to prevent drift. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself.  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

### Constraints & Non-Goals
- **Language/Stack**: Python 3.11+ primary (Pydantic v2, asyncio, httpx, dataclasses). Optional: chromadb/FAISS for vector memory, fastapi/uvicorn for server, langgraph for adapter only. No heavy framework lock-in for core loop.
- **Minimalism First**: Core loop + state + reliability + basic hierarchical in <2k LOC initially. Add evolution/xAI hybrid in later phases.
- **No Uncontrolled Loops**: Hard `max_steps`, cycle detection (state hash), progress-based exit, circuit breakers. All LLM calls use strict output_schema (Pydantic/JSON mode or constrained decoding).
- **Security**: Sandbox code execution tools; never trust LLM-generated tool args blindly (validate + least-privilege); monitor for anomalous patterns (e.g., rapid repetition).
- **Cost Control**: Token budgets, parallel only for independent branches, summarization on context pressure, early termination when criteria met.
- **Non-Goals (Phase 1-2)**: Full distributed execution (Ray/Celery later), GUI dashboard (CLI + JSON export first), multimodal native (text+code focus; vision via xAI or sub-agent), production multi-tenancy.

### 2.4 Final Architectural Decisions (Post-100x Rethink)
- **Loop Style**: Controlled custom ReAct (dataclass/Pydantic State + hash cycle detect + circuit breakers) as foundation. Hierarchical on top (Orchestrator decides delegate vs tool vs synthesize vs finish). Not flat multi-agent (central control beats coordination chaos per research).
- **State**: `AgentState` (task_spec: TaskSpec, history: List[TraceEvent], todo: List[TodoItem] or todo_md_content, plan: Optional[Plan], memory_short: Summary + recent, memory_long: VectorStore + key_facts, versions: VersionRegistry, tracer: Tracer, budgets: Token/StepBudget, seen_hashes: set for cycles).
- **Memory Strategy**: Structured `todo.md` / key_facts (primary, low token) + aggressive summarization (on context pressure or milestone) + optional vector (Chroma/FAISS) for semantic retrieval of past traces/versions/knowledge. Sub-agents get **sliced context + provenance only**.
- **LLM Calling**: Unified client (support xAI direct, DeepSeek, OpenAI compat via LiteLLM or custom). All calls: system + few-shot (dense for research, sparse for embodied) + strict `output_schema` (Pydantic model_dump_json or JSON mode). Enforce parseability.
- **Tools**: Registry with validation. Safe execute wrapper (circuit + retry + structured error obs). Sandbox for code_execution (restricted globals or firejail/subprocess).
- **xAI Hybrid Specific**: `XAIClient` wrapper for `grok-4.20-multi-agent` calls. Payload: narrow sub_objective + success_criteria + enabled_tools list + context_slice. Parse leader final answer + optional reasoning. Log as special Observation with `source: "xai_multi_agent"`, `agent_count`, `synthesis_confidence`.
- **Self-Evolution Scope (Phased)**: Phase 2+: Prompts & verifier prompts. Phase 3+: Tool code (dynamic generation + validate). Phase 4: Agent configs/roles, even sub-spec generation heuristics.
- **Testing Dogfood**: Build failure simulator that replays MASFT examples; assert mitigations. Use the harness to improve its own prompts/verifier on held-out traces during development.
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable LLM backend, Tool types, SubAgent roles (registry + factory), Memory backends, Evolution strategies. CLI for single runs; server mode (FastAPI) for multi-session / integration with OpenWebUI-style frontends.

### 3.1 High-Level Flow (Phases from agent_loop.md, Hardened)
1. **Phase 0: Initialization**
   - Parse instruction → generate/validate `TaskSpec` (Pydantic: objective, success_criteria: List[str], constraints: Dict, output_format, max_steps=50, token_budget=200k, quality_gates, initial_plan?).
   - Spec Validator + Critic (LLM): Check completeness, ambiguity, role clarity, termination conditions. Reject/revise if FM-1.x risks high.
   - Create `AgentState`: task_spec, todo (from plan or empty), memory, tracer, version_registry, budgets, seen_hashes=set().
   - Optional: Planner LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps + deps) + todo.md content. Validate plan vs spec.
   - Decide architecture: flat | hierarchical | hybrid_xai.

2. **Phase 1: Core Controlled ReAct Loop**
   - While not terminate:
     - Build context (summarize history if long + key_facts + todo + task_spec + latest obs).
     - LLM Decision (strict schema): `thought` (analyze progress vs criteria, gaps, risks, strategy; re-ground vs objective), `action_type` ("tool" | "delegate" | "synthesize" | "finish" | "reflect"), `payload` (args or sub_spec).
     - Cycle check: hash recent (action+obs) ; if seen → force replan or terminate.
     - Execute: safe_tool (circuit + retry + sandbox) or safe_delegate (sub loop or xAI call) or internal.
     - Structured Observation: `{status, data, summary, confidence, issues, next_suggestions, provenance, trace_id, versions_used}`.
     - Append TraceEvent to history + update todo/progress + memory.
     - Light reflection (every N or on error): Quick self-critique alignment.
   - CircuitBreaker per tool_name/role (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN logic as in attached code; track metrics).
   - Termination signals: success_criteria met + verifier pass, max_steps/budget, explicit verified Finish, irrecoverable (escalate), early exit on intermediate criteria met.

class AgentState(BaseModel):
    task_spec: TaskSpec
    history: List[TraceEvent] = Field(default_factory=list)
    todo: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # or todo_md: str
    plan: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    memory_short: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    memory_long_ref: Optional[str] = None  # vector ids or summary
    seen_hashes: set = Field(default_factory=set)  # for cycle detection
    budgets: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    versions: Dict[str, str] = Field(default_factory=dict)  # current active
    tracer: List[TraceEvent] = Field(default_factory=list)  # or separate Tracer class
```

### 3.3 Key Modules to Implement (with Skeletons from attached + Enhancements)
- **core/loop.py**: `controlled_react_loop` (enhance attached code with Pydantic, full state, MASFT-aware prompts, xAI hybrid hooks, progress tracking).
- **reliability/circuit_breaker.py**: Enhanced class with metrics, per-tool/role instances, integration with safe_execute.
- **reliability/verifier.py**: `verify_output` + `VERIFIER_PROMPT` tuned to catch FM-1.x/2.x/3.x (e.g., "Does this respect original task_spec and roles? Any premature termination or incomplete verification? Cross-check claims vs observations.").
- **hierarchical/orchestrator.py**: Planner logic, delegation router, sub-agent factory, consolidator.
- **evolution/self_evolver.py**: `self_evolve_component` (TextGrad-style: diagnose from trace, propose_edit, validate_improvement, VersionManager.register).
- **tea/protocol.py**: Minimal TCP/ECP/ACP schemas, register_tool/register_agent, get_context_slice, VersionManager.
- **integrations/xai.py**: `call_grok_multi_agent(sub_spec, tools_enabled, context_slice)` → parse leader result into StructuredObservation.
- **memory/ & tracing/**: As described.
- **prompts/**: Versioned JSON/YAML or .md files for system prompts, few-shots (ReAct decision, verifier, planner, reflector, sub-roles). Include MASFT failure mode references in critic prompts.

- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers + retries + backoff (per attached safe_* wrappers). Structured error obs always. Budget enforcement + graceful degradation. Progress-based early exit.
- **Security**: Tool sandbox (restricted Python exec or isolated subprocess/Docker for code_execution; browser tools via controlled libs). Validate/sanitize all LLM-generated args before execution. Least-privilege tool access. Anomaly detection on loop patterns (e.g., rapid same-action repetition → circuit open + alert).
- **Observability**: Tracer is first-class. Every event: full context snapshot option (configurable), versions, token counts, timings, sub-calls. Export JSONL / Parquet. Replay function: `replay_trace(trace_id, from_step=5)`. Optional OpenTelemetry export or integration with user's Jenkins/OpenWebUI logging.
- **Cost/Scalability**: Per-phase budgets. Parallel only independent branches (asyncio). Summarization signals (context length + semantic importance). Session isolation for concurrency.
- **Extensibility**: 
  - LLM backends via abstract client or LiteLLM.
  - Tools: Simple registry + Pydantic schema validation.
  - Sub-agents: Factory + role prompts in registry.
  - Memory: Pluggable (in-memory dict, vector store, persistent DB).
  - Evolution strategies: Swap TextGrad for other (e.g., Reflexion-only).
  - Adapters: LangGraph state machine wrapper; export to Grok Build ACP/MCP skills; FastAPI endpoints for remote orchestration.
- **Deployment**: `pyproject.toml` with optional deps. Docker minimal (Python + venv). Local-first by default. Server mode for multi-user/integration if needed (Keycloak OIDC ready pattern from user's stack).

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration + Cognitive Layer):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA). **v2 addition**: Human cognitive frameworks (top-ranked in thinking_model.md) provide the highest-leverage missing layer for adaptive intelligence, proactive risk handling, fast/slow deliberation, and multi-level learning — directly mapped in agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4.  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency. Cognitive routing (Cynefin) helps decide when to delegate vs local fast path.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization + **Pattern Store for RPD**) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces + **AAR/Double-Loop structure**) to prevent drift. **Cognitive config** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, critic_modes) per TaskSpec for adaptability without complexity explosion on simple tasks. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself (including its own cognitive components).  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3) **+ cognitive mitigations** (e.g., Premortem for spec/design risks, Metacognition + cycle detection for repetition, AAR/Double-Loop for verification/termination gaps, RPD for context/history issues via pattern matching).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Controlled core with cognitive mode selection (Fast Recognition Path) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution + full AAR/Double-Loop/5Whys critics → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; **cognitive features validated** (Cynefin classification accuracy, Premortem risk coverage, RPD hit rate on repeated tasks, AAR structure compliance, Double-Loop assumption questioning); full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

### Constraints & Non-Goals
- **Language/Stack**: Python 3.11+ primary (Pydantic v2, asyncio, httpx, dataclasses). Optional: chromadb/FAISS for vector memory, fastapi/uvicorn for server, langgraph for adapter only. No heavy framework lock-in for core loop.
- **Minimalism First**: Core loop + state + reliability + basic hierarchical in <2k LOC initially. Add evolution/xAI hybrid in later phases.
- **No Uncontrolled Loops**: Hard `max_steps`, cycle detection (state hash), progress-based exit, circuit breakers. All LLM calls use strict output_schema (Pydantic/JSON mode or constrained decoding).
- **Security**: Sandbox code execution tools; never trust LLM-generated tool args blindly (validate + least-privilege); monitor for anomalous patterns (e.g., rapid repetition).
- **Cost Control**: Token budgets, parallel only for independent branches, summarization on context pressure, early termination when criteria met.
- **Non-Goals (Phase 1-2)**: Full distributed execution (Ray/Celery later), GUI dashboard (CLI + JSON export first), multimodal native (text+code focus; vision via xAI or sub-agent), production multi-tenancy.

### 2.4 Final Architectural Decisions (Post-100x Rethink)
- **Loop Style**: Controlled custom ReAct (dataclass/Pydantic State + hash cycle detect + circuit breakers) as foundation. Hierarchical on top (Orchestrator decides delegate vs tool vs synthesize vs finish). Not flat multi-agent (central control beats coordination chaos per research).
- **State**: `AgentState` (task_spec: TaskSpec, history: List[TraceEvent], todo: List[TodoItem] or todo_md_content, plan: Optional[Plan], memory_short: Summary + recent, memory_long: VectorStore + key_facts, versions: VersionRegistry, tracer: Tracer, budgets: Token/StepBudget, seen_hashes: set for cycles).
- **Memory Strategy**: Structured `todo.md` / key_facts (primary, low token) + aggressive summarization (on context pressure or milestone) + optional vector (Chroma/FAISS) for semantic retrieval of past traces/versions/knowledge. Sub-agents get **sliced context + provenance only**.
- **LLM Calling**: Unified client (support xAI direct, DeepSeek, OpenAI compat via LiteLLM or custom). All calls: system + few-shot (dense for research, sparse for embodied) + strict `output_schema` (Pydantic model_dump_json or JSON mode). Enforce parseability.
- **Tools**: Registry with validation. Safe execute wrapper (circuit + retry + structured error obs). Sandbox for code_execution (restricted globals or firejail/subprocess).
- **xAI Hybrid Specific**: `XAIClient` wrapper for `grok-4.20-multi-agent` calls. Payload: narrow sub_objective + success_criteria + enabled_tools list + context_slice. Parse leader final answer + optional reasoning. Log as special Observation with `source: "xai_multi_agent"`, `agent_count`, `synthesis_confidence`.
- **Self-Evolution Scope (Phased)**: Phase 2+: Prompts & verifier prompts. Phase 3+: Tool code (dynamic generation + validate). Phase 4: Agent configs/roles, even sub-spec generation heuristics.
- **Testing Dogfood**: Build failure simulator that replays MASFT examples; assert mitigations. Use the harness to improve its own prompts/verifier on held-out traces during development.
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable LLM backend, Tool types, SubAgent roles (registry + factory), Memory backends, Evolution strategies. CLI for single runs; server mode (FastAPI) for multi-session / integration with OpenWebUI-style frontends.

### 3.1 High-Level Flow (Phases from agent_loop_v3.md, Hardened with Cognitive Layer)
1. **Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven + Cognitive Setup)**
   - Parse instruction → generate/validate `TaskSpec` (Pydantic: objective, success_criteria: List[str], constraints: Dict, output_format, max_steps=50, token_budget=200k, quality_gates, initial_plan?, **cognitive_profile: Dict** e.g. {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "auto"}).
   - Spec Validator + Critic (LLM): Check completeness, ambiguity, role clarity, termination conditions. Reject/revise if FM-1.x risks high. **Run Premortem Analysis**: "Assume this spec/plan fails spectacularly — identify top causes and mitigations; merge into living spec, success_criteria, todo, and quality_gates."
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): Tag task context (Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic) based on cause-effect clarity, expertise needed, emergence, or crisis. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop params (Fast path preference for Simple/Complicated; Full + heavy reflection for Complex/Chaotic).
   - Create `AgentState`: task_spec (with cognitive_profile + cynefin_tag), todo (from plan or empty), memory (incl. Pattern Store for RPD), tracer, version_registry, budgets, seen_hashes=set(), **current_mode: "fast" | "full"**.
   - Optional: Planner LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps + deps) + todo.md content. Validate plan vs spec **+ Premortem risks**.
   - Decide architecture: flat | hierarchical | hybrid_xai. Set initial mode from Cynefin + config.

2. **Phase 1: Core Controlled ReAct Loop (with Cognitive Mode Selection)**
   - While not terminate:
     - **v2 Mode Selection (Cynefin + RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition)**: At start of iteration or after major obs, determine operating mode:
       - If Cynefin allows (Simple/Complicated) **and** high-similarity match in Pattern Store (RPD) **and** metacognition confidence high → **Fast Recognition Path**: lightweight Thought (mental simulation referencing matched trace), minimal tokens, proceed to action. Log mode for AAR review.
       - Else → **Full Deliberative Mode** (detailed ReAct Thought with re-grounding + full gates). Run lightweight parallel **Metacognition Monitor** (bias scan, progress vs criteria, context drift, confidence pulse) that can force mode switch or early replan.
     - Build context (summarize history if long + key_facts + todo + task_spec + latest obs + relevant Pattern Store entries for RPD).
     - LLM Decision (strict schema): `thought` (**Metacognitive overlay** first: "Right mode? Biases per Paul-Elder? Progress vs criteria?"), `action_type` ("tool" | "delegate" | "synthesize" | "finish" | "reflect"), `payload` (args or sub_spec). In Fast mode: keep concise.
     - Cycle check: hash recent (action+obs) ; if seen → force replan or terminate.
     - Execute: safe_tool (circuit + retry + sandbox) or safe_delegate (sub loop or xAI call) or internal.
     - Structured Observation: `{status, data, summary, confidence, issues, next_suggestions, provenance, trace_id, versions_used, mode_used}`.
     - Append TraceEvent to history + update todo/progress + memory (update Pattern Store on high-quality outcomes).
     - Light reflection (every N or on error): Quick self-critique alignment **+ mode effectiveness note**.
   - CircuitBreaker per tool_name/role (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN logic as in attached code; track metrics; integrate with mode for cost-aware decisions).
   - Termination signals: success_criteria met + verifier pass, max_steps/budget, explicit verified Finish, irrecoverable (escalate), early exit on intermediate criteria met **or strong Fast-path success on sub-criteria**.

5. **Phase 4: Reflection & Self-Evolution (Advanced — AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys + Multi-Perspective Critics)**
   - At milestones or end (or on explicit reflect action): Full trace + mode history to SelfEvolver.
   - **Mandatory Structured AAR** (4-question template from After-Action Review):
     1. What was supposed to happen? (vs original TaskSpec + plan + success_criteria)
     2. What actually happened? (from tracer + StructuredObservations, including Fast vs Full mode stats and RPD matches)
     3. Why? (diagnosis — standard attribution + deep pass with **5 Whys** on top issues + **Ishikawa Fishbone** or fault tree categorization: Prompts/Methods, Models/Tools, Data/Obs, Context/Env, State/Memory, Verification, Human Spec)
     4. What next? (actionable lessons → concrete edits)
   - **Double-Loop Learning Layer** (after AAR single-loop diagnosis): Explicitly question governing variables/assumptions (e.g., "Was our definition of quality too loose? Did role boundaries allow drift? Should success_criteria or cognitive_profile defaults evolve?"). Only meta-approved changes proceed to proposal.
   - Diagnose root causes (MASFT-aware + cognitive lens prompt, referencing FM modes and thinking_model mappings).
   - Propose targeted edits (prompts, tool code, role defs, sub-spec heuristics, **even cognitive_profile defaults or new critic modes**). Use Paul-Elder standards or Red Team attack during diagnosis/proposal where configured.
   - Validate improvement on held-out or replay (re-run with new version; check success rate/steps/verifier scor

**Context & Principles**  
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** first: Clear specs drive everything.  
- Prioritize **highest-ranked** items on feature/skill/rule overlap (ECC #1 > Karpathy rules #2 > claude-mem #3 > shanraisshan best-practice #4 > antigravity-awesome-skills #5, etc.).  
- Keep it **portable, minimal-Docker where possible, local-first**, with excellent security, memory, and token efficiency.  
- Output must be **agent-friendly**: clear phases, checklists, acceptance criteria, and hooks for critic/review agents.  
- Support iterative refinement (plan → implement → review → improve loops).  
- Target users: Solo developers, small teams, or power users building custom AI coding workflows (aligns with harness engineering + N1ch01as-style meta-systems).

**Success Criteria**  
- New project folder initializes in < 5 minutes with one main script.  
- ECC fully installed + configured as core harness.  
- Karpathy behavioral rules active by default.  
- Persistent memory (claude-mem or equivalent) enabled.  
- High-value skills from top libraries selectively merged (no duplication).  
- Best-practice configs, hooks, rules, and example workflows included.  
- Security baseline (AgentShield or equivalent) active.  
- Clear docs + task.md for further extension.  
- Works cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows where possible) and with multiple agents.  
- Includes quality gates (lint, tests, review prompts).
- **All supported coding agents share the exact same curated skills, rules, and hooks** via automated or documented synchronization from a single source of truth.

This section is significantly strengthened based on deep research from xAI (Grok multi-agent capabilities, Grok Build agentic coding focus, transparent/auditable reasoning) and high-quality 2025–2026 research (Reflexion, Self-Refine, SAGE multi-agent self-evolution, SCALAR Structured Critic–Actor Loop, human-in-the-loop self-improvement frameworks, context folding/memory architectures).

**Research-Backed Design Principles**
- **Multi-agent critic patterns** (xAI Grok Multi-Agent + SAGE): Use specialized roles (Actor/Solver + Critic/Challenger + optional Judge) that can work in parallel. Each sub-agent shows its reasoning for full auditability and transparency.
- **Structured self-critique** (SCALAR, Reflexion, Self-Refine): Move beyond vague feedback. Use explicit verification of preconditions, state tracking, rubric scoring, and episodic memory of past reflections/critiques.
- **Human-in-the-loop safety** (strong research consensus): All high-impact changes require human confirmation. Optional human guidance when domain knowledge evolves rapidly.
- **Memory & context management**: Support hierarchical summaries, reflection storage, and context folding for long-horizon tasks (enhancing claude-mem with ideas from AgentFold / Recursive Language Models research).
- **Transparency & auditability** (core xAI philosophy): Every sub-agent reasoning step, critique, and decision is logged and reviewable.
- **ECC-first + Research layer**: Start with ECC’s existing review/critique capabilities as the foundation, then layer on stronger multi-agent critic loops and structured reflection.

**Core Routine Flow** (Actor → Multi-Agent Critic → Refine + Memory loop)
- **Actor/Solver**: Generates the implementation or solution using ECC skills + Karpathy rules.
- **Critic/Challenger** (can be multi-agent): Runs structured self-critique using the enhanced rubric. Can spawn parallel sub-agents for deeper analysis on different dimensions (e.g., one for security, one for simplicity). Produces scores + specific issues + concrete, actionable improvement suggestions.
- **Reflection Storage**: Critiques, lessons learned, and successful patterns are stored in episodic memory (build on claude-mem or add dedicated structured reflection store with hierarchical summaries).
- **Refine Loop**: Actor uses the critique + stored reflections to improve the output. Supports multiple iterations with intelligent context management.
- **Human Confirmation Gate**: High-impact suggestions (especially skill/rule changes) go through the human confirmation workflow.
- **Full Audit Log**: All reasoning traces, critiques, and decisions are recorded for transparency and later review (xAI-style auditability).

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Verify current top repos (use web search or direct GitHub):
   - ECC (affaan-m/ECC) – primary harness (skills, agents, hooks, rules, security, MCP).
   - Karpathy rules (forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills or multica-ai mirror) – behavioral CLAUDE.md.
   - claude-mem (thedotmack/claude-mem) – persistent memory.
   - shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice – workflows & patterns.
   - sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills – bulk skill library (selective install only high-value bundles).
2. [ ] Identify overlaps and decide:
   - Core harness/rules/hooks/security/MCP → **ECC first** (highest rank + most comprehensive).
   - Behavioral guidelines → **Karpathy rules** (add as base or merge into ECC rules if compatible).
   - Memory → **claude-mem** (or ECC's built-in memory/instincts if sufficient; prefer dedicated if better persistence).
   - Planning / best-practice workflows → Merge from shanraisshan + ECC's planning skills.
   - Bulk skills → Use antigravity-awesome-skills installer but **curate** only top 20–50 most useful (planning, TDD, review, security, frontend, etc.). Avoid installing everything.
3. [ ] Check for official Anthropic skills or new high-rank additions since last check.
4. [ ] Document decisions in `docs/decisions.md` (use ECC's research-first style).

## Phase 3: Memory, Skills & Selective Library Integration (Priority #3 & #5)

**Objective**: Add persistent memory and curated high-impact skills.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Memory persists across sessions and improves context for long tasks.
- Curated skill set is lean yet powerful (document which ones were chosen and why).
- Easy way to add/remove skills later.

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Enable **AgentShield** (or ECC security) + secret detection, vulnerability scanning.
2. [ ] Configure key **hooks** (pre-commit validation, post-completion review, context compaction, cost tracking).
3. [ ] Set up **MCP configs** for common tools (GitHub, file system, etc.) – start minimal and secure.
4. [ ] Apply ECC token optimization settings (MAX_THINKING_TOKENS, compact thresholds, etc.).
5. [ ] Add `.gitignore`, license (MIT), and contributor guidelines.
6. [ ] Create bootstrap script(s) in `scripts/`:
- `bootstrap.sh` or `install.js` that runs ECC install + memory + curated skills + config copy.
- Support flags for different agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

**Initial Priority Order for Implementation**:
1. ECC foundation (Phase 1)
2. Karpathy + best practices (Phase 2)
3. Memory + curated skills (Phase 3)
4. Security/hooks/MCP (Phase 4)
5. Docs + validation (Phase 5)



### From `corpus/root/project_starter_0.2.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/project_starter_0.2.md`.


1. Making **ECC the foundation**, but installing curated profiles first instead of blindly copying everything.  
2. Replacing Bash-first sync with a **cross-platform Node.js CLI**.  
3. Defining **one source of truth** and generated adapters with drift checks.  
4. Treating “same skills/rules everywhere” as **semantic parity**, not identical file format parity.  
5. Adding license, source, checksum, and version manifests.  
6. Separating **instructions**, **skills**, **memory**, **hooks**, **MCP**, and **generated tool configs**.  
7. Adding an explicit **security threat model**.  
8. Replacing “log all reasoning traces” with **auditable summaries, evidence, decisions, diffs, commands, test results, and review outputs**. Do not request or store hidden chain-of-thought.  
9. Making self-improvement **proposal-only until human approval**.  
10. Adding measurable quality gates, sync tests, and install-time budgets.

1. **ECC** — primary cross-agent harness foundation.  
2. **Karpathy-style behavioral rules** — concise behavioral layer.  
3. **claude-mem or equivalent** — persistent memory if compatible and safe.  
4. **Claude Code best-practice repositories** — selected planning/workflow patterns.  
5. **Curated skill libraries** — selective import only; no bulk install by default.  
6. **Official agent docs** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, GitHub Copilot.

1. **SDD first:** Specs drive implementation.  
2. **ECC-first on overlap:** Prefer ECC components, naming, conventions, security, and cross-harness architecture unless a source audit proves a better fit.  
3. **Karpathy behavior layer:** Think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution.  
4. **Single source of truth:** Central `skills/`, `rules/`, `hooks/`, `mcp-configs/`, and manifests are authoritative.  
5. **Generated adapters:** `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc. are generated or documented from the source of truth.  
6. **Safe by default:** No destructive automation, remote MCP, or skill mutation without explicit human approval.  
7. **Local-first:** Prefer local scripts, local memory, local audit logs, and optional external services.  
8. **Minimal core, optional bundles:** Starter must be lean; large skill libraries are curated, not fully installed.  
9. **Cross-platform:** macOS, Linux, Windows/PowerShell/WSL where possible.  
10. **Auditable, not opaque:** Store concise rationales, evidence, decisions, diffs, commands run, test results, and review summaries. Do **not** require hidden chain-of-thought.

```

a) Load AgentDefinition for agent_id=1 (DirectorAgent)
  b) Fetch input artifacts from Asset Store
  c) Fetch relevant memories from MemoryAgent (vector search)
  d) Construct LLM messages:

e) Call LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro):
     response = await llm.chat(messages, tools=[veo_api, memory_store])

MemoryAgent isn't just another agent — it's a **shared service** that other agents call:
